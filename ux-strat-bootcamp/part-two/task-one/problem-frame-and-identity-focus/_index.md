Map out the problem and pick an important place to focus. The problem you choose to solve must be a manageable piece that you can solve in one week. 

### How to do this? 
Interview real people in order to uncover needs that they have, which they may or may not be aware of. To get useful information you need to interview a good, preferably randomised sample of users/people (7-10) and ask good questions. 
Preparation: Write down a list of questions (7-10) to be used in your interviews and the approach you will follow to ensure that you obtain (and document) as much useful information as possible.
