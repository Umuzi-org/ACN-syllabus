After a full day of understanding the problem for your user, today you will focus on sketching possible solutions for your user. Review existing ideas and think of how you can remix and improve them. Sketching possible solutions is something that anyone can do but it doesn’t come naturally. Remember, the solution that you come up with is what you will prototype. 

### How to do this?
You should have a stack of solutions. But remember, too many solutions are also a problem because you can’t prototype and test them all—you need one solid plan. Spend some time critiquing each solution, and decide which one(s) have the best chance of being prototyped and tested on Thursday. Then, in the afternoon, you’ll take the winning scenes from your sketches and weave them into a storyboard: a step-by-step plan for your prototype.
