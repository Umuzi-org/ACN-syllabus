In-depth interviews and quantitative research helps us get a better sense of the people we’re designing for. There’s no better way to understand the hopes, desires, and aspirations of those you’re designing for than by talking with them directly. Interviews can be a bit daunting, but when done correctly will help you unlock all kinds of insights and understanding that you’ll never get sitting behind your desk. Whenever possible, conduct your interviews in the interviewee’s space. You can learn so much about a person’s mindset, behaviour, and lifestyle by talking with them where they live or work.

### Task (1hr)
Pair up with another bootcamper - that's the person you’ll be designing for a.k.a your user - and take turns interviewing each other to better understand their weekly or daily commute. Ensure that you document as much as possible during this step - take extensive notes, take pictures collect samples etc.

### How to do this? (1hr)
Begin by understanding their morning commute. Ask not just about logistics, though: find out and learn about how they feel, what they wish for, what gets in their way. Your job is to ask great questions, listen, and learn. Tip: Don’t be afraid to ask “Why?” Take turns interviewing each other. Start transitioning - if you were interviewed first, now take a hand at being the interviewer, and vice versa. 

### Interpret your findings: Interpret your user’s needs (30min)
Search for meaning in what you just learned. Take a couple of minutes to read over your notes from the interview with your partner. Write down answers to the following questions:
- What are **3 unique aspects** of your user’s commute? 
- What are **3 needs your user** faces daily?

### Preparation
Write down a list of questions to be used in your interviews and the approach you will follow to ensure that you obtain (and document) as much useful information as possible. Aim for 7-10 questions good questions.
