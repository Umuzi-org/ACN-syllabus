In order to interact properly with Git, you'll need to know a little bit about "the command line".

The first step is to open the command line or terminal on your device:

- If you are running Android, then open your termux app
- If you are running Windows, then
  - open your git shell OR
  - using [linux subsystem for windows](https://itsfoss.com/install-bash-on-windows/), just open your linux terminal
- If you are using mac or linux, jkust open your terminal

If this is the first time you've ever opened such a program, DONT PANIC! You'll get used to this thing.

Now you'll need to learn a few basic commands to get by:

Make sure you understand everything up to step 14.

Later on, if you get into Umuzi, you'll be expected to know all that stuff. But for the bootcamp, just the basics are ok.
