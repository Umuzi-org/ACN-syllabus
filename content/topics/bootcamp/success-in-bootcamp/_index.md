title: Success in bootcamp
---

Welcome to our bootcamp. If you made it this far, well done! You're a star.

For the next couple of weeks you are expected to behave like this is your full-time gig. That means you need to work hard. You'll be using our custom learning platform and you'll be interacting with our staff and each other as though you are already part of our community.

It's going to be hard work!

## We don't expect you to finish everything, but try to stretch yourself!

We've given you a lot of stuff to get through. For most of you it will be WAY too much. Just do your best and focus on understanding. If you don't finish all the exercises it's alright. Just take them one at a time and do your best.

Please try to do the projects in order from top to bottom. We need you to show us some very specific skills. If you get into the program then you'll have more flexibility about the order in which you  do things. But for now, please, start from the top.

## Focus on understanding!

When you complete a piece of work then please make sure you understand what you did. Professionals get asked to do some pretty complicated things sometimes, so you need to make sure you are a ninja when it comes to the foundational skills.

This isn't like high-school, memorizing stuff and getting hints isn't the way to go, understanding is golden.

## Keep an eye on your inbox

You're going to be invited to collaborate on a bunch of Github repos as time goes by. It is CRITICAL that you accept those invites. Otherwise you wont be able to do the required work.

### Communication

**Be responsive:** If someone sends you a message, make sure they know when you have read it. Don't ignore people. If talking to you feels like talking to a brick wall then you wont fit in here.

**Be clear:** Whenever you send someone a message, read over it before you press send. Think about it from the perspective of the person who is reading it. Will they understand you? Are you giving them enough information?

Example of bad communication:

```
applicant: I have a problem
staff member: What is your problem?
applicant: the code wont run
staff member: Is there an error message?
applicant: here is a shakey, blurrey video of my computer: [attatchment: suuuuucks.zip]
staff member: Please send me the error text as actual text
applicant: here it is: [one tiny useless part of the error message]
staff member: Sometimes I wonder how we got this far as a species (quits job)
```

Example of good communication:

```
applicant: Hi. I'm struggling to get my code to work. I'm working on this project [link to project]. When I do [X] then [Y] happens. I expected [Z]. It's giving me the following error message: [The full error message as text]
staff member: Here is an explanation [explanation], and here are some resources so you can learn more [resources]. And... I love you (+2 to faith in humanity)
```

**Be Kind** Be polite. We aren't rigid and formal here, but we do expect you to act respectfully towards the staff and your colleagues. No form of abuse will be tolerated. We are about helping each other to grow.

### Being on time

The ideal: Don't be late for meetings. And if you are given a deadline then make sure you meet it.

Life is messy sometimes being perfect isn't always possible. That's ok, we're all human and we can understand when things are hard. But it is on _YOU_ to communicate effectively.

- if you can't make it to an event: say something ahead of time. As soon as you see a problem, communicate about it
- if you think you wont hit a deadline: say something ahead of time. As soon as you see a problem, communicate about it

I'm sure you see the pattern...

## Intelligent things that you should do

If you get into our program you'll be expected to seek out help when you need it, and you'll be expected to help each other. Practice that now.

If you get stuck: Don't suffer in silence. Ask the other bootcampers, and ask the staff. Be a team player.

If you help someone, don't just give them code to use. They need to understand how to solve the problems themselves. For real. If we catch people copying each other or encouraging copying then those people will be rejected from our program.

If you ask someone for help, don't just ask them for answers. You need to understand how to solve the problems yourself.

## Silly things you really should avoid doing

Ok, this is a bit heavy. But it's really important that you understand this stuff.

If we catch you copying each other's work, we'll immediately take you off the program. Why? Because we need to train professionals who can actually do work and add value. When you get a job as a professional coder you'll be asked to build things that nobody has ever built, there will be nobody to copy from.

If you are disrespectful or abusive towards any of your peers or staff members and we see it, you're out. We don't expect you to be super formal or anything, just be kind to each other.

If you don't make a plan to show up for your interviews and tests then we wont be keen to work with you. That said, we are reasonable people so if you need to reschedule something or you are having a problem, let us know so we can make a plan.

If you suck up to staff members or try to bribe your way in, you're out.

## Don't be a spammer

Don't add random people as reviewers on your pull requests, that is called spam. Everyone you add to your PR gets an email. Don't just randomly add everyone. That's just annoying.

Respect people's time. There was one bootcamper who somehow got the CTO's personal phone number and thought it was ok to send midnight messages asking for help with code. That kind of thing is not no appropriate. You need to respect the boundaries of staff members and of your peers.

## How you should prioritize your work

Please start at the top of your backlog, and work your way down. Try to minimize multi-tasking. Multi-tasking will slow you down.

If you are given feedback: Look at it as soon as you can. Deal with the feedback and learn from it so you don't make the same mistakes. If a staff member reviews your work and asks you to fix three things, then you need to fix all three. Not just one thing. Not just 2. Everything.

## How we choose who stays and who goes

We value teamwork, honesty, clear communication and professionalism. We'll be looking for that stuff.

We'll also be looking closely at the work you do of course. The work you do should be tidy, clear, and complete. Don't submit any half-arsed projects.

We might also be scheduling a few interviews with you where we'll test different things. So keep an eye on your Google calender, and Gmail inbox!

Once we have all the info we need to make our decisions, we'll start crunching the data. You'll get the results to you as quickly as we can.

## What happens if you don't make it?

We believe in second chances. If you don't make it through our bootcamp and you want another shot then that's fine with us. You'll be able to prepare a bit better for the next bootcamp now that you know how things work.

Just so you know I'm serious: There was once a student who tried to get into Umuzi 3 times! Eventually he got in. His hard work and persistence paid off. After his learnership was done we liked him so much that we hired him. Since then he's moved onto great things - now he's living the dream, and geeking hard at a major multi-national company!
