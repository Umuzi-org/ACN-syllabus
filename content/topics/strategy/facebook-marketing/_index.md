Strategy recruits are taught Facebook marketing and apply it in the recruitment department to attract high potential candidates. They can also use digital tools (Canva) to design simple ads.

How recruits learn the skill and associated tools:

The theory of Facebook marketing is taught through Facebook’s own website through the following course:

- [Learn With Facebook Blueprint] (https://www.facebookblueprint.com/student/catalog)

Practice of the skill: Supporting the recruitment manager to set up Facebook marketing campaigns during the organisation’s recruitment drives.

Recruits apply the skill in recruitment where they work with the recruitment manager to develop Facebook ads which are the primary source Umuzi applicants.
