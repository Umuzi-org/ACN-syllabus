title: Java File IO
---

It's all good and well writing programs that a user can interact with, and programs that print stuff out to the screen. But that has limited usefulness. Serious programs generally have some form of data persistence.

Basically programs often need to store data, or access stored data. And there are a lot of different ways to make that happen.

For now we'll be focusing on reading and writing files.

## Resources:

- https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_files.asp a gentle introduction to file io
- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_files_io.htm this one is a bit less gentle
- https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io this one is very thorough, and the offical docs are practically always the best place to find the latest and greatest info
