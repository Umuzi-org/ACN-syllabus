Consuming an API refers to the process of calling an API from an application. The methods available for an application to consume an API are mapped to the API itself. For instance, if the API does not contain a GET endpoint, then the application can't consume the API using a Http(s) GET call.

You can either consume and existing SOAP service or a REST api and in this topic we are going to cover both. Lets jump into it.

# Consume a REST API

As we now know in development there is always more than one way to do something and this applies to consuming apis as well. In a spring application you can use 2 of the most popular rest clients which are:

1. HttpClient: Sends request to and gets response from server over HTTp protocol and takes care of the following as well

   - HTTP protocol interception

   - Secure HTTP connections - SSL/TLS

   - HTTP proxy server handling

   - Handles HTTP cookies

   - Connection pooling for different hosts, keep alive strategy,

   - multi-threaded request execution

2. Rest Template: is the central Spring class for client-side HTTP access. Conceptually, it is very similar to the JdbcTemplate, JmsTemplate, and the various other templates found in the Spring Framework and other portfolio projects. This means, for instance, that the RestTemplate is thread-safe once constructed, and that you can use callbacks to customize its operations. It uses HttpClient under the hood.

Now that we have covered those its time to look into what makes up a connection

What you might need to learn first about consuming a REST api is the terminology used to describe the parts of the request

1. `URl`: Uniform Resource Locator, is a reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network. (e.g http://localhost:8080)

2. `Body`: The body of an Http call refers to data that's being sent to the API that is not displayed in the url. A body is usually sent using
   POST-, PUT-, and PATCH-methods. The body must match what is expected in the API method. In Spring Boot, it must match the
   @RequestBody variable.

3. `Headers`: Headers are additional information passed along in the Http request. Usual use cases for Headers are: - Passing through Authentication tokens. - Describing the format of the request body.

**Now Consuming an API using REST**

We are going to use the rest template to connect to out API. Imagine the API is hosted at the following url: `http://www.myapi.com`

## GET call: Used to fetch data from an API

If the GET endpoint is located at http://www.myapi.com/getendpoint and the endpoint is expecting a String variable called id, then the
GET call would look like the following:

```
RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
String userResourceUrl = "https://www.myapi.com/getendpoint";
ResponseEntity<String> response = restTemplate.getForEntity(userResourceUrl + "/1", String.class);

// Check if the status code is successful, since we get the entire response object
assertThat(response.getStatusCode(), equalTo(HttpStatus.OK));

```

Cause we have the entire response object we can do something a bit more cleaver when serializing objects from the response
for example

```
public class User implements Serializable {
    private long id;

    private String name;

	private String surname
    // standard getters and setters and constructor
}

// Now we can do a get by using getForObject() and map it to User DTO

User user = restTemplate
  .getForObject(userResourceUrl + "/1", user.class);

```

## POST call: Used to save data

If the POST endpoint is located at http://www.myapi.com/postendpoint and is expecting a model containing a name and surname String variable
then the POST call would look like the following:

```

RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
String userResourceUrl = "https://www.myapi.com/postendpoint";

HttpEntity<Foo> request = new HttpEntity<>(new User("Bob", "Khumalo"));
User user = restTemplate.postForObject(UserResourceUrl, request, User.class);
```

## DELETE call: Removing a record

If the DELETE endpoint is located at https://www.myapi.com/mydeleteendpoint, the DELETE endpoint would look
like the following:

The DELETE call works similar to the GET call in the way that it passes data through to the API. The parameter is sent in the Url and not in
the request body.

```
RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
String userResourceUrl = "https://www.myapi.com/deleteendpoint";
long id = 2;

String entityUrl = userResourceUrl + "/" + id;
restTemplate.delete(entityUrl);

// You can do a get of the same ID afterwards to see if still exist

```

# Consuming SOAP Web Service

This is the second kind of web service you mights be required to consume which is more involved that the REST API.

First lets learn some terminology of all the things you will working on

1.  `wsdl`: web service description language - is an XML-based file that basically tells the client application what the web service does. The WSDL file is used to describe in a nutshell what the web service does and gives the client all the information required to connect to the web service and use all the functionality provided by the web service.

    - Below is the general structure of a WSDL file

          	- Definition: It defines the name of the web service.

          	- TargetNamespace: Is a convention of XML Schema that enables the WSDL document to refer to itself

          	- DataTypes: Defines the types for input and output

          	- Messages: Defines the data elements for each operation

          	- Porttype: Describes the operations that can be performed and the messages involved.

          	- Bindings: Defines the protocol and data format for each port type.

          	- service: A collection of related endpoints.

2.  `xsd`: is a file used to define what elements and attributes may appear in an XML document. It also defines the relationship of the elements and what data may be stored in them

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?><wsdl:definitions xmlns:wsdl="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/" xmlns:sch="https://medium.com/article" xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/soap/" xmlns:tns="https://medium.com/article" targetNamespace="https://medium.com/article">
  <wsdl:types>
    <xsd:schema xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" elementFormDefault="qualified" targetNamespace="https://medium.com/article">

    <xsd:element name="getArticleRequest">
        <xsd:complexType>
            <xsd:sequence>
                <xsd:element name="id" type="xsd:int"/>
            </xsd:sequence>
        </xsd:complexType>
    </xsd:element>

    <xsd:element name="getArticleResponse">
        <xsd:complexType>
            <xsd:sequence>
                <xsd:element name="article" type="tns:article"/>
            </xsd:sequence>
        </xsd:complexType>
    </xsd:element>
```

The first most important process of consuming a wsdl is generating classes from the wsdl which can be used in the project. We have multiple ways to consume wsdl but we will explore 1 which is Jax-WS if you would like you can also checkout [spring-ws](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ws/docs/3.0.9.RELEASE/reference/).

1. Jax-WS: Is a technology for building web services and clients that communicate using XML e.g SOAP

2. Spring-WS: Aims to facilitate contract-first SOAP service development, allowing for the creation of flexible web services using one of the many ways to manipulate XML payloads

### Jax-WS (Java API for XML Web Services)

The process of generating wsdl can be done as a build task so it execute at run time. You want to be able to do this so that your application can be deployed and function on different environments outside your local setting.

This process is quite complex and lengthy but you can checkout the [example](https://spring.io/guides/gs/consuming-web-service/). I have added some code snippet and explanation below for some of the sections.

Basic gradle dependencies this will be coupled with a build task which points to the source and destination of the wsdl and generated files

```
implementation ('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web-services') {
	exclude group: 'org.springframework.boot', module: 'spring-boot-starter-tomcat'
}
implementation 'org.springframework.ws:spring-ws-core'
// For Java 11:
implementation 'org.glassfish.jaxb:jaxb-runtime'
compile(files(genJaxb.classesDir).builtBy(genJaxb))

jaxb "com.sun.xml.bind:jaxb-xjc:2.1.7"

```

To create a web service client you will need to extend WebServiceGatewaySupport and put your operations in there

```
import com.medium.user.GetUserRequest;
import com.medium.user.GetUserResponse;
import org.springframework.ws.client.core.support.WebServiceGatewaySupport;

public class UserClient extends WebServiceGatewaySupport {

    public GetUserResponse getUser(int id){
        GetUserRequest getUserRequest = new GetUserRequest();
        getUserRequest.setId(id);
        return (GetUserResponse) getWebServiceTemplate().marshalSendAndReceive(getUserRequest);
    }
}

```

Then you need to configure `Marshalling`(refers to the process of converting the data or the objects into a byte-stream), Spring Web Service uses Spring Frameworkâ€™s OXM module (mapping XML data), which has the Jaxb2Marshaller to serialize and deserialize XML requests.

```
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.oxm.jaxb.Jaxb2Marshaller;

@Configuration
public class UserConfiguration {

  @Bean
  public Jaxb2Marshaller marshaller() {
    Jaxb2Marshaller marshaller = new Jaxb2Marshaller();
    // this package must match the package in the <generatePackage> specified in
    // gradle
    marshaller.setContextPath("com.example.consumingwebservice.wsdl");
    return marshaller;
  }

  @Bean
  public UserClient userClient(Jaxb2Marshaller marshaller) {
    UserClient client = new UserClient();
    client.setDefaultUri("http://localhost:8080/ws");
    client.setMarshaller(marshaller);
    client.setUnmarshaller(marshaller);
    return client;
  }

}

```

There is however a more simpler way which is more suited for our use case which is generating the files local and testing them. I can imagine that you can add this command in a build script that run on a deployed application but maybe that exploration is for another day. To do this we need to know what `wsimport` is.

- `wsimport`: Available in you JDK bin directory, is used to parse an existing Web Services Description Language (WSDL) file and generate required files for web service client to access the published web services.

To generate the classes you would do something like

```
wsimport -keep -p com.mypackage.wsdl http://localhost:8080/ws/countries.wsdl

```

`-keep`: Store the files in disk.

`-p`: specifies target package (where we are getting the wsdl from), this one http://localhost:8080/ws/countries.wsdl is hosted 'remotely'.

Now we have the classes in the this package `com.mypackage.wsdl` we can start using it to communicate with our web service and its as simple as this

```

public class EmployeeServiceClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        URL url = new URL("http://localhost:8080/employeeservice?wsdl");

        EmployeeService_Service employeeService_Service = new EmployeeService_Service(url);
        EmployeeService employeeServiceProxy  = employeeService_Service.getEmployeeServiceImplPort();

        List<Employee> allEmployees = employeeServiceProxy.getAllEmployees();
    }
}

```
