title: Introduction to Tilde

Welcome to Tilde. We built it with love.

Here is little video tour of the first features you'll be interacting with: https://youtu.be/NC7PmQ-3aCg

**Please Note:** The login mechanism uses a popup,if you are using ad blockers and popup blockers you'll need to turn that off.

If you are new to dev stuff, it's going to look a little weird. Don't worry. Before you get too deep into how we actually use this thing, it'll be good for you to know a bit about the principles and practices that inspired the design.

The first thing to know is that software development on a team is hard. And most techies work on a team. Back in the early days of software development things sucked. A lot. Software projects generally just failed, even big ones backed by people with really solid technical skills. Projects were mostly either late, broken, over-budget or the features were just wrong. If you want success in this line of work, knowing how to use tech is just the tip of the iceberg lettuce.

So after lots of suffering, the software industry started figuring out ways of working that are actually effective. There are loads and loads of things to be said about those methods. But the main thing to know for now is that we designed Tilde in such a way as to get you to practice those methods. The way you'll be working through this course is really quite similar to how industry giants build epic software.

Basically, Tilde is based on a thing called Kanban. Read this excellent article to understand what Kanban is all about: https://kanbanize.com/kanban-resources/getting-started/what-is-kanban

Ok cool! So Tilde is basically a kanban board. Each card you see on the board is a piece of work that you need to get done. And it's your mission to get al the cards from the Backlog to Complete.

And of course, the whole point of this thing is to make sure you get the skills you need to launch your successful career. This is not a box-ticking exercise. In getting your cards to Complete you need to make sure you really understand all the concepts that the card is about. Don't race to finish, the point is not to move as quickly as possible. The point is to understand.

So please ask questions when you need to :)

And learn to ask questions well! (yes, this is a skill you can develop)
