title: Unit testing (language agnostic concepts)
---

The following videos use JavaScript to demonstrate and explain some key concepts around unit testing. Even if JS is not your vibe these are worth watching.

- Lesson 1: [Why Unit Testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu35xM76kKY&
  list=PL0zVEGEvSaeF_zoW9o66wa_UCNE3a7BEr&index=1)
- Lesson 2: [Your first tests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsFQEUP1MxI&index=2&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeF_zoW9o66wa_UCNE3a7BEr)
- Lesson 3: [Test Runners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdx2HjFRaJY&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeF_zoW9o66wa_UCNE3a7BEr&index=3). This discussion on test runners mentions a bunch of JS stuff. But there are still many language agnostic concepts that are worth knowing about. Examples of Python test runners are unittest and pytest.

If you are actually doing JS then it's worth watching the rest of this series of videos.
