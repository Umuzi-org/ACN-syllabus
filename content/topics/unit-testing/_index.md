title: Unit testing (language agnostic concepts)
---

The following videos use JavaScript to demonstrate and explain some key concepts around unit testing. Even if JS is not your vibe these are worth watching.

When it comes to foundational coding, a lot of the concepts are the same across different languages. A function is a function is a function. Even though these videos are in JS, they cover things that are very foundational.

The hard part of learning to unit test is learning what makes a good test and learning about what tests are really for. That knowledge translates to all languages.

- Lesson 2: [Your first tests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsFQEUP1MxI&index=2&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeF_zoW9o66wa_UCNE3a7BEr)
- Lesson 3: [Test Runners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdx2HjFRaJY&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeF_zoW9o66wa_UCNE3a7BEr&index=3). This discussion on test runners mentions a bunch of JS stuff. But there are still many language agnostic concepts that are worth knowing about. Examples of Python test runners are unittest and pytest.

If you are actually doing JS then it's worth watching the rest of this series of videos.

## Python resources

These resources cover the basics in Python.

## Java resources

junit is very fundamental when starting to test java projects but you will also soon realised that there are many libraries out there for testing depending on what you are trying to achieve with your tests
