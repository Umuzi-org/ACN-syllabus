title: Intro to bridging course
---

Congrats! You made it into the bridging course.

Getting through the full Umuzi program is pretty hard. We made this course so that we can make sure we can set as many people up for success as possible. The worst thing we can do is accept someone into our course when they aren't quite ready for it because if a person is not quite work-ready by the end then it's a waste of a year and really stressful and horrible for everyone involved.

The idea behind this course is to allow you to polish up a few skills that were covered in the bootcamp. We also want to help you learn how to learn more effectively and add a little shine to some of your so-called "soft" skills. (Soft skills are hard you guys)

You can learn how to learn better. Being an effective learner will supercharge your whole life.

## How to be successful

The first thing to know is that you'll have a bunch of cards on your Tilde boards. You need to deal with those cards in the usual way.

Make sure you read everything properly and focus on understanding.

## FOCUS NOW

Understating is CRITICAL!!!

If you manage to get all your Tilde cards into the Complete column and one of our staff members talks to you and it turns out that you don't understand the code that you submitted then we wont be able to accept you into any of our full programs.

This is not a race, there is no prize for the person who finishes first.

If you can UNDERSTAND all the stuff covered in this course then you're golden. **Even if that means you move your cards slowly.**

Make sure you read everything properly.

If you submitted work during the bootcamp and you didn't 100% understand it, then please go back and revisit that stuff.  Re-do the tutorials and make sure you master the material. You should be able to do the projects yourself! As a professional you will be asked to do way harder stuff, **if you want a career then master the material**.

## It's our job to make content that helps you understand

That means that if anything is ambiguous or confusing, we need to sort things out so that it makes sense.

We wont be spoonfeeding you though. We want to turn you into a professional. Professionals overcome problems and seek understanding. So if you ask a question that you should be able to figure out on your own we might tell you to go figure it out. Don't take it personally. Seeking understanding is like gym for your brain.

## This is self paced learning

We won't be expecting you to work on any specific schedule. But we will expect you to be consistent. Try to build a sustainable habit. Work on this course a bit every day.

If you are moving too slowly and you are in danger of not finishing the bridging course in time then we'll let you know as soon as we can. Then you'll be able to adapt quickly.

## Your target

You have a lot of cards on your board. We need you to get the following into the "COMPLETE" column:

Everything up to and including the first three Assessment cards. When you move an assessment card into the "review" column then you're basically asking to be tested. If you UNDERSTAND all the code you wrote and all the concepts covered then you'll do fine in the tests.

## Danger zone

If we catch anyone cheating we will unfortunately need to **permanently reject** that person from  our program. That person will never get invited to take part in any of our programs or bootcamps ever again!

The Umuzi opportunity changes people's lives. Don't throw it away by cheating. Some of you are in this bridging course because we caught you cheating once already. We believe in second chances, this is it.

### What is cheating?

If you submit code that you wouldn't be able to write on your own then that would be considered cheating.

You can ask people to help you understand, but all the code you submit should be completely written and understood by you.

If we give you a test to write and the answers are copied from the internet or you have someone else write your test for you then that's cheating.

You will only be considered to have passed the bridging course if you provably understand all the concepts covered.

Our final tests are actually pretty easy. If you understand all the code you submit during the bridging course then you'll be able to rock the test. We aren't aiming to catch anyone out with trick questions or anything like that, if you did the work yourself we want to set you up for an epic career.

## What happens when you're finished?

Once you finish the bridging course you'll get onto a waiting list. Then the next time we start a program, you'll be able to join in. Generally people aren't on the waiting list for very long.

We'll also add some more cards to your board so you can keep up your habit of learning.

## Meetings

From time to time you'll be invited to take part in live discussions. These will happen on Google Meet. Here's what you need to know:

1. You need to watch your inbox to make sure you don't miss any invitations
2. When you get an invitation you eed to respond to it. Say "yes" if you can make it, "no" if you cant. If you can't make it then let us know why so we can reschedule
3. Be on time. Set an alarm and try to be a few minutes early so that nothing goes wrong
4. Make sure you are somewhere with good internet and electricity. It's your professional responsibility to be present. For example, If you have load shedding you need to find a place where you can work from
5. You'll need a working microphone so you can take part in the discussion
6. Try to join on an actual computer if you can, there will generally be a screen share going on and you'll need to be able to read the code that is displayed

## The end

That's it! Good luck :)
