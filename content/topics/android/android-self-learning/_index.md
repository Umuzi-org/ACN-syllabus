You are expected to spend your free time learning and practicing your Android development skills. Here are some resources for you. Different people tend to prefer different resources because they support different styles of learning.

## Some of our favourite Android resources across multiple mediums

One of the most powerful mediums in getting started with Android development is online video courses/tutorials.
What is extremely important is to code along with the videos. You can always rewind if you feel like you've missed something.

### Udacity

Udacity consists of a wide range of videos spanning multiple programming languages and is free to sign up for. While there are paid courses, the free courses are more than enough to get you started.

Look out for the following:

[Kotlin bootcamp for programmers by Google](https://www.udacity.com/course/kotlin-bootcamp-for-programmers--ud9011).

The bootcamp might not be Android specific, but will assist with familiarising yourself with Kotlin and will help in getting to know the syntax and structure of the language.

[Developing Android apps with Kotlin by Google](https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps-with-kotlin--ud9012).

[Advanced Android with Kotlin by Google](https://www.udacity.com/course/advanced-android-with-kotlin--ud940).

Make sure to start off with the simpler bootcamp courses before jumping into the advanced courses. These courses were designed by Google and provide videos along with documentation on each section.

### Udemy

Similar to Udacity, Udemy consists of online courses. While most are paid courses, they have regular specials in which a course can be purchased for R100 - R200.

[The complete Android Kotlin developer course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-kotlin-developer-course/).

[Kotlin Android development masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/kotlin-android-developer-masterclass/).

### Android documentation

When it comes to all things Android you can find most of what you need on the [Android developer website](https://developer.android.com/kotlin).

For more information regarding User Interface design, [Tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/android/android_ui_design.htm) and the
[Android developer website](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui) have some great pages that drill down into the various components and layouts.
