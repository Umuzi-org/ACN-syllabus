## Naming files and directories

You can organize your files and directories in a logical and consistent manner by using naming conventions. The use of naming conventions helps to ensure the correct information can be located, identified, and retrieved from a file system quickly, as well as that it is stored in a secure location.

has a different style, internal consistency should take precedence.
