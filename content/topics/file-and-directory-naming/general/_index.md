## Naming files and directories

You can organize your files and directories in a logical and consistent manner by using naming conventions. The use of naming conventions helps to ensure the correct information can be located, identified, and retrieved from a file system quickly, as well as that it is stored in a secure location.

## What should I consider when naming files and directories

New files and directories (including third-party frameworks) should adhere to the recommended naming conventions, but if a library already exists that 
has a different style, internal consistency should take precedence.

## Language specific naming conventions 

- Python : {{% contentlink path="topics/file-and-directory-naming/python" %}}
- JavaScript : {{% contentlink path="topics/file-and-directory-naming/javascript" %}}
- Java : {{% contentlink path="topics/file-and-directory-naming/java" %}}
