title: Basic introduction to Github

Git and Github are friggin wonderful. Trust me on this. During your time on this learning journey, you'll be using these wonderful tools a lot.

Unfortunately though, for people who are just getting started, Git and Github can feel pretty be weird.

Please go through this content and do your best to understand all the things.

## Github versus Git

One thing to know is that Git and Github are not the same thing. Git is a foundational tool; you don't need to use Github if you want to use Git.

Github is a web application and a collection of tools that make Git useful.

Github has a few competitors. For example [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) and [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) are both quite awesome. You can even host your own github alternative on your own server one day, [Gogs](https://gogs.io/) is an example of that.

## IMPORTANT: Course expectations

During your course here with us, you'll be expected to use GitHub like a professional developer. Professional developers use the "command line". The documentation we give you here should help you get to grips with the basics of what git and GitHub are about. But we don't do things that way.

You'll learn more about how to use the command line in this project:
{{% contentlink path="projects/git-exercises" %}}. We'll cover that later, but if you feel like doing that now, go wild :)

Generally, you'll be expected to use the command line for anything to do with:
- downloading code
- uploading code
- branching
- committing
- some merging

And then you'll use the GitHub user interface for:
- creating pull requests
- reviewing pull requests
- merging good pull requests
