Git and Github are friggin wonderful. Trust me on this. During your time on this learning journey, you'll be using these wonderful tools a lot.

Unfortunately though, for people who are just getting started, Git and Github can feel pretty be weird.

Please go through this content and do your best to understand all the things.

## Github versus Git

One thing to know is that Git and Github are not the same thing. Git is a foundational tool; you don't need to use Github if you want to use Git.

Github is a web application and a collection of tools that make Git useful.

Github has a few competitors. For example [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) and [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) are both quite awesome. You can even host your own github alternative on your own server one day, [Gogs](https://gogs.io/) is an example of that.

## How you'll be using Github

Professional coders do all sorts of fancy things with Github. For now, we don't need you to be very fancy.

When you start certain kinds of projects then we will create Github repos for you. You will be expected to just upload your work into the right repo. That's it.

For now please don't worry about making branches and pull requests or anything like that.  We just need you to be able to give us your work so we can mark it.
