Software development and data science can be really powerful. And with great power come great responsibility, Uncle Ben was right.

Here are some basic rules worth following:

- don't ship bad code. [Bugs can be pricey](https://raygun.com/blog/costly-software-errors-history/). Test test test
- read [this](https://www.computer.org/education/code-of-ethics)

## Law

There are a few laws in place around the storage of sensitive information. Notably:

- [PCI DSS](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) if you are storing credit card information
- [POPI](https://www.miltons.law.za/a-summary-of-popi-the-protection-of-personal-information-act-act-no-4-of-2013/) if you are storing personal information

There is no need to memorize these laws. Just know what they exist. In general, if information in your care can be used by bad characters then:

- keep it safe
- check if there is a law or standard that applies to your situation
- don't be evil. Don't use the "I'm just doing my job" excuse if your employer insists that you do dodgy things.
