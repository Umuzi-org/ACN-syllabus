## What Is Web Design?

Web design is a Web development process that focuses on the look and feel of the website, factors like 

- Layout 
- Colour
- User Interface 
- Responsiveness 
- Accessibility

are all considered and organized to create a website or web application that looks good and is easy to use.

### Layout & Responsive design
_Layout and responsiveness are connected so while learning how to make your site responsive you will learn different layouts to achieve responsiveness._

A responsive website changes shape / or layout to accommodate different devices. Since cell phones are so powerful these days it is usually considered best practice to design your site in a "mobile-first" way. This means that you should first make sure that your site works well on a phone, then you make sure it works well on larger devices.

This is generally achieved through the use of CSS-Grid.

### Accessibility

A lot of people have disabilities. When you design a website, you should try to keep that in mind.

Here's a great introduction to web accessibility.

### Colour
Colour and consistency are important in web applications and sites. Read this [article](https://www.tictocdigital.co.uk/journal/46-the-importance-of-colour-in-web-design) to get a better idea and understanding of this.


### Difference between bad and good design?

The main difference between good and bad websites is determined by visual appeal (how good it looks to the user) and consistency. A good website shows a clear structure, easy-to-use navigation, and non-distracting design, while a bad website makes you feel confused or even annoyed.



### Guidelines for achieving good Web Design

Please remember user interfaces are for users. Think about your users and how they will interact with your work.

### Basics:

- Make sure your front-end is discoverable. What would a new user think to do when they arrive for the first time?
- Make sure that your front-end is learnable. If you need your users to take novel actions make sure that the users can remember how to do those actions later.
- The user is always right. If a user gets confused by your website then it means that your website is confusing. Swallow your pride and accept criticism.
- Always have an escape strategy. If a user clicks on a button and navigates somewhere strange, they should be able to go back.
- Don't use too many colours. And remember that some of your users will be colour-blind
- Be consistent.
- Make sure that the most important parts of your site look important. Make them big, and put them at the top. Guide your users to interact with the right components.
- Make desired actions easy. Imagine two e-commerce sites with a similar style, selling similar items. On-site A the user needs to click the mouse 10 times to make a purchase, on-site B the user needs to click the mouse 3 times to make a purchase. Site B will make more sales.
- Familiarity breeds trust. If your website looks familiar then people will take it seriously

### Design Principle: KISS

### Tools for design
Before developing your site it is normally a good idea to have a clue of what it should look like, this can save you time and have you working towards a better design. 
You can create your wireframes and prototypes using different software. 
A great open-source tool to try out is Figma.
