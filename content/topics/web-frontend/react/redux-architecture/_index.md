title: React + Redux architectural guidelines
---

Redux is pretty cool. But also pretty weird... Once you start writing complicated applications things can get pretty confusing.

The best thing to do is learn to follow some good practices around organizing your code. You need some good habits and solid structures that will scale with your apps.

What you need to do is:

- think critically about how you organise your code
- be consistent and predictable

Here are a few resources that will help you think through the tradeoffs involved in structuring your redux code.
