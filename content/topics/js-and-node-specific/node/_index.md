Wikipedia.org defines Node.js as an open-source, cross-platform and JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.

Node.js lets you write JavaScript code that runs on a server. This has many uses:

- Command line utilities and utility scripts.
- Web app backends that dynamically generate web page html or expose apis.

Here are a few articles to get your head around the concepts:
