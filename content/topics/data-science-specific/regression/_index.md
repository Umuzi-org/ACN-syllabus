Regression is all about finding relationships between variables.

Complete the Khan Academy section on [bivariate numerical data](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/describing-relationships-quantitative-data). Remember to do the practice sections and unit test.

Once you have completed the basic regression section above, complete the Khan Academy section on [advanced regression](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/advanced-regression-inference-transforming).
