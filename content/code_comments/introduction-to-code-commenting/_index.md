title: Understanding Effective Comments in Coding
---

## Introduction

In programming, comments play a crucial role in code documentation. They provide explanations, clarifications, and additional context to make the code more understandable for developers. However, not all comments are created equal. It is important to distinguish between good comments and bad comments to ensure effective code communication. Let's explore what makes a comment good or bad.

## Characteristics of a Good Comment

- Purposeful Explanation: A good comment serves the purpose of explaining complex logic, algorithms, or business rules. It provides insights into the code's functionality and helps other developers understand the intentions behind certain decisions.

  ```python
  def factorial_recursive(n):
      """
      Calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer using recursion.

      Args:
          n (int): The non-negative integer for which to calculate the factorial.

      Returns:
          int: The factorial of the input integer 'n'.

      Notes:
          - This function uses recursion and follows the mathematical definition of factorial.
          - Be cautious when using large input values, as it may cause a stack overflow.
      """
      if n == 0:
          return 1
      else:
          return n * factorial_recursive(n - 1)

  ```

  > In this example, the comment above the function provides a purposeful explanation of what the function does, clarifies the approach used (recursion), and warns about the potential issue of stack overflow for large input values.

- Clarity and Readability: A good comment is clear, concise, and easy to read. It uses proper grammar, punctuation, and formatting conventions. Well-structured comments make it easier for developers to follow the code and comprehend its meaning.

  ```python
  def calculate_sum(numbers):
      """
      Calculate the sum of integers in a given list.

      Parameters:
          numbers (list of int): A list of integers.

      Returns:
          int: The sum of all integers in the list.

      Example:
          >>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
          >>> calculate_sum(numbers)
          15

      Notes:
          - This function iterates through the list and adds each integer to the sum.
          - The function returns 0 if the list is empty.
      """
      sum = 0
      for num in numbers:
          sum += num
      return sum
  ```

  > In this example, the comment above the function is well-structured and easy to read. It clearly describes the function's purpose, parameters, and return value. It also uses proper grammar and punctuation to ensure clarity and readability.

- Relevant Information: A good comment provides relevant information that is not immediately apparent from the code itself. It adds value by offering insights, reasoning, or describing the intention behind a particular approach or solution.

  ```python
  # Calculate the total price of items in the shopping cart
  total_price = 0

  for item in shopping_cart:
      subtotal = item.price * item.quantity
      total_price += subtotal

  if total_price > spending_limit:
      discount = total_price * 0.1  # 10% discount for exceeding the spending_limit
      total_price -= discount
  ```

  > In this example, the comment explains the purpose of the code, which is to calculate the total price of items in a shopping cart and apply a discount if the total price exceeds the spending limit. It clarifies the logic behind the code and provides insight into the discount calculation, which might not be immediately obvious from the code itself. The comment adds relevant information that helps other developers understand the intention and behaviour of the code segment.

- Updates with Code Changes: A good comment is maintained and updated alongside the code. If the code undergoes modifications, the corresponding comments should be reviewed and revised to ensure they accurately reflect the updated logic. If you add too many unnecessary comments then those comments would need to be maintained. So it's better to write self-documenting code as much as possible so that you need to maintain fewer comments.

  ```javascript
  // Function to calculate the factorial of a number
  // Negative numbers are not supported
  function factorialRecursive(n) {
    if (n === 0) {
      return 1;
    } else {
      return n * factorialRecursive(n - 1);
    }
  }

  // Function to calculate the factorial of a number
  // Negative numbers are supported
  function factorialRecursive(n) {
    if (n < 0) {
      throw new Error("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.");
    } else if (n === 0) {
      return 1;
    } else {
      return n * factorialRecursive(n - 1);
    }
  }
  ```

  > In this example, the comment above the function is updated to reflect the changes in the code. The updated comment now includes a base case for negative numbers to prevent infinite recursion. It is important to keep comments up-to-date with the code logic.

- Avoidance of Redundancy: A good comment avoids repeating what is already evident from the code. It focuses on explaining aspects that may not be immediately obvious, such as complex algorithms or non-standard approaches.

  ```javascript
  function findMaxElement(arr) {
    let max = arr[0];
    // Loop through the array to find the maximum element
    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
      // Compare the current element with the current max
      if (arr[i] > max) {
        // If the current element is greater, update max
        max = arr[i];
      }
    }
    return max;
  }
  ```

  > In this example, the comment above the for loop is redundant since the code itself is self-explanatory. The comment adds little value and can be removed without affecting the code's readability.

## Characteristics of a Bad Comment

- Irrelevance: A bad comment lacks relevance to the code or provides information that is obvious from reading the code itself. Irrelevant comments clutter the codebase and can confuse or mislead developers.

  ```java
  int x = 10; // Initialize the variable x with a value of 10
  ```

  > In this example, the comment adds little value since the code itself is self-explanatory. The comment is redundant and does not provide any additional insight or explanation.

- Outdated or Inaccurate Information: A bad comment contains outdated or incorrect information. If a comment no longer aligns with the current code logic or behaviour, it becomes misleading and should be removed or updated accordingly.

  ```javascript
  // Function to calculate the square of a number
  // (Note: We are using the old approach for squaring, use the new one instead)
  function square(number) {
    return number * number;
  }
  ```

  > In this example, the comment contains outdated information, suggesting there's a newer approach for squaring numbers. However, the code remains unchanged, making the comment misleading. It's important to keep comments up-to-date with the code logic.

- Vague or Ambiguous Descriptions: A bad comment fails to provide clear explanations or uses ambiguous language. Unclear comments can cause confusion and hinder code comprehension instead of enhancing it.

  ```java
  import java.util.List;

  public class ShoppingCart {
      private List<Item> items;

      // Function to process the items in the cart
      public void process() {
          for (Item item : items) {
              // Do something with the item
              item.process();
          }
      }
  }
  ```

  > In this example, the comment above the process() function is vague and ambiguous. It fails to provide any meaningful explanation of what the function does or how it works. The comment is unclear and does not add any value.
  > A better comment would be more explicit and descriptive, explaining what the process method does in a clear manner

  ```java
  import java.util.List;

  public class ShoppingCart {
      private List<Item> items;

      // Process each item in the cart by updating its status and calculating the total price
      public void process() {
          for (Item item : items) {
              item.updateStatus();
              item.calculateTotalPrice();
          }
      }
  }
  ```

  > In this example, the comment above the process() function is more explicit and descriptive. It explains what the function does in a clear manner, which helps other developers understand the code's intention and behaviour.

- Sarcasm, Insults, or Personal Opinions: A bad comment contains sarcasm, insults, or personal opinions that are unprofessional and create a negative work environment. Comments should maintain a respectful and collaborative tone.

  ```java
  // This brilliant piece of code magically fixes the bug!
  int result = (divisor != 0) ? dividend / divisor : 0;
  ```

  > In this example, the comment uses sarcasm and an unprofessional tone, which can create a negative work environment and undermine effective collaboration.

## Self-Documenting Code

An essential aspect of effective code communication is self-documenting code. Good code makes its intentions clear through various means:

- Clear Algorithms: Well-organized and logically structured algorithms help developers understand the flow and purpose of the code without relying heavily on comments.

  ```javascript
  function isPrime(number) {
    if (number <= 1) {
      return false;
    }

    for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(number); i++) {
      if (number % i === 0) {
        return false;
      }
    }

    return true;
  }
  ```

  > In this example, the isPrime function is self-documenting in terms of its algorithm. The code follows a clear algorithm for checking whether a given number is prime or not. The algorithm avoids the need for excessive comments because it is structured logically and easy to understand

- Well-Chosen Names: Thoughtfully selected variable and function names that convey their purpose can significantly improve code readability. Meaningful names reduce the need for excessive comments by expressing the code's intent directly.

  ```python
  def calculate_average(numbers_list):
    total_sum = 0
    num_elements = len(numbers_list)

    for number in numbers_list:
        total_sum += number

    average = total_sum / num_elements

    return average
  ```

  > In this example, well-chosen names have been used to enhance code readability and express the code's intent directly.The meaningful names make the code more self-explanatory, reducing the need for excessive comments.

- A common problem is something like this

  ```javascript
  // Calculate the temperature in Fahrenheit given the temperature in Celsius
  function calculate(temp) {
      return ....
  }
  ```

  > In this example, the comment is redundant since the function name already conveys its purpose. A better approach would be to use a more descriptive function name, such as `calculateFahrenheitFromCelcius`.

Comments as Needed: While striving for self-documenting code, there will still be instances where comments are necessary to provide critical context or explain intricate details that may not be immediately obvious.

## Common Problems Encountered by New Programmers

- Paraphrasing Code in Comments: New programmers often fall into the trap of paraphrasing code in comments, leading to redundant and unhelpful comments. For instance: `sum = 0 // initialize the sum variable to 0`. Comments like these add no real value and clutter the codebase.

- Omitting Comments Completely: Some new programmers may receive feedback discouraging them from making useless comments, which can result in the omission of comments altogether. While overly verbose or redundant comments should be avoided, omitting all comments can make the code harder to understand, especially for others who may work on the codebase in the future.

## Conclusion

Understanding the difference between good comments and bad comments is essential for effective code communication and collaboration. Good comments provide purposeful explanations, relevant information, and clarity, while avoiding redundancy and outdated content. By following these principles, developers can create comments that enhance code comprehension, facilitate maintenance, and promote a positive coding environment.
