- assessment_criteria:
  - The review identifies and explains the feasibility of the requirements. 
  - The review identifies the database access objectives and critical performance factors. 
  - The review estimates the development effort required so that the cost may be estimated. 
  - A review procedure is adopted, which ensures that the outcomes meet the database access requirements. 
  outcome: 1
  title: Review the requirements for database access for a computer application using SQL.
- assessment_criteria:
  - The design implements user requirements. 
  - The design of the database structure resembles the output from the data analysis. 
  - The structure of each table in the database adheres to the third normal form. 
  - The methods of accessing the data are identified. 
  - The key relationships between the tables within the database are identified. 
  - The data types for primary and foreign keys are consistent throughout the database. 
  outcome: 2
  title: Design database access for a computer application using SQL.
- assessment_criteria:
  - The program code implements the program design. 
  - The program code uses language constructs that facilitate the understanding of the code. 
  - The program code utilises the optimising features of the languages being used. 
  - The program code uses language instructions that facilitate the understanding op the code. 
  - The program code uses language constructs that facilitate the understanding of the code. 
  - Tables joined in a query are essential to its outcome. 
  - The program code uses constructs that preserve the integrity of the data being accessed by multiple users and processes. 
  - Global data sharing is minimised to enable weak coupling, and modules exhibit functional cohesion.
