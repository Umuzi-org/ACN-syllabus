It should be labelled like: FirstName LastName - Research Notes
   
Required format: Google Doc

Upload the document to google drive and submit a link. Ensure that the submission has the `docx` file extension. Please make sure that the link works. If your work is private then we won't be able to review it. You can double-check this by opening your own link in an incognito browser.  

Your link should look like this:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YtW4iBMCZuBYxUf1YCZGsDRFminxXKk9/view?usp=sharing or https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YtW4iBMCZuBYxUf1YCZGsDRFminxXKk9/edit
