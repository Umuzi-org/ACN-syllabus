### 1. Professionalism in the IT industry in South Africa

Professional Ethics concerns one's conduct of behaviour and practise when carrying out professional work. Such work may include consulting, researching, teaching and writing. The institutionalisation of Codes of Conduct and Codes of Practice is common with many professional bodies for their members to observe.

A **code of conduct** governs the behaviour of professionals. In other words, it deals with issues such as integrity, loyalty, impartiality, responsibility, and discrimination.

A **code of practice** deals with how a professional is expected to exercise their responsibilities, or how they carry out their duties. This includes keeping up-to-date with new technologies and legal requirements, being aware of security or privacy issues, and applying sound management practices.

Any code may be considered to be a formalisation of experience into a set of rules. A code is adopted by a community because its members accept the adherence to these rules, including the restrictions that apply.

#### Examples

**Not Acceptable**

- Saving Personal and Confidential information (PCI) on a personal device.
- Using unauthorised copies of software.
- Convincing a client to buy a computer system or IT equipment that far exceeds their needs.

**Acceptable**

- Saving PCI on official and authorised devices.
- Researching and using alternative open-source software that provides similar functionality.
- Identifying customer needs before offering solutions.

#### Professional Bodies in South Africa

**Institute of Information Technology Professionals South Africa (IITPSA)**

https://www.iitpsa.org.za/

ITPSA, established in 1957, is a professional body serving and representing South Africa’s Information and Communications Technology (ICT) professionals and practitioners. They engage with Industry and Government on ICT policy as well as the wider community with the aim to:

- further the study, science and application of ICT,
- maintain and promote Codes of Conduct and Ethics for our members,

In 2014, the South African Parliament passed the Protection of Personal Information Act (PoPIA) to protect the data and privacy of consumers. As you develop your game you must remain in compliance with this act. Respecting your users’ data and keeping it secure is especially important to maintain trust with your users.

You can view the act [here](https://popia.co.za/) or download a copy [here](https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/201409/3706726-11act4of2013protectionofpersonalinforcorrect.pdf)

### 3. Codes of ethics and piracy

#### Equality of Opportunity

Equal opportunity broadly speaking describes the fair and equal treatment of colleagues and employees. It has come to mean much more in recent decades and now includes the promotion of historically oppressed and discriminated groups eg. women, people with disabilities etc. In South Africa, it also includes Black Economic Empowerment.

The computer industry in South Africa supports the Equality of Opportunity. The IITPSA’s (see previous sections) Code of Conduct clearly states:

Do not engage in discriminatory practices in professional activities on any basis whatsoever.

Moreover, specific organisations are working towards creating more diversity in the industry:

[The Black Information Technology Forum](http://www.bitfgp.co.za)

[Women in Tech SA chapter](https://women-in-tech.org/sa/)


#### Digital Piracy

Digital piracy is an ongoing worldwide issue preventing the IT industry from reaching its full potential. Digital piracy includes computer software but also extends to digital entertainment, particularly music and movies. Many local and international organisations are trying to control and stop this phenomenon.

South Africa is no exception to this problem; a survey by MyBroadband revealed that 53% of respondents pirated content online and another report showed South Africa in a top 10 list of nations that illegally downloaded the first episode of the latest season of Game of Thrones via BitTorrent, the most popular tool to do this.

There are two organisations in South Africa backed by the government that is committed to stopping piracy and can report on it:

**1. The Business Software Alliance (BSA)** is an international association founded by software producers to help combat software piracy. They aim to:

- Bring South Africa’s copyright laws in line with the standards set by the World Intellectual Property Organisation.
- Create a government-backed enforcement policy and to lobby for tougher anti-piracy laws.
- Encourage the government to dedicate more resources to combating piracy through training for law enforcement.
- Improve public education and awareness.
- Lead by example by encouraging government departments to use only legitimate software, whether it is open-source or purchased from private suppliers.

**2. The Southern African Federation Against Copyright Theft (SAFACT)** is a local organisation that works not only against software piracy but also against music and film copyright infringements. SAFACT in particular is trying to tackle the problem through:

- Engaging and collaborating with local Internet service providers.
- A mandate granted by the Motion Picture Association to act against local copyright-infringing parties and sites; penalties include jail for up to five years and can result in a fine of up to R10,000.
