- assessment_criteria:
  - The review identifies and explains the feasibility of the requirements.
  - The review identifies the database access objectives and critical performance
    factors.
  - The review estimates the development effort required so that the cost may be estimated.
  - A review procedure is adopted, which ensures that the outcomes meet the database
    access requirements.
  outcome: 1
  title: Review the requirements for database access for a computer application using
    SQL.
- assessment_criteria:
  - The design implements user requirements.
  - The design of the database structure resembles the output from the data analysis.
  - The structure of each table in the database adheres to the third normal form.
  - The methods of accessing the data are identified.
  - The key relationships between the tables within the database are identified.
  - The data types for primary and foreign keys are consistent throughout the database.
  outcome: 2
  title: Design database access for a computer application using SQL.
- assessment_criteria:
  - The program code implements the program design.
  - The program code uses language constructs that facilitate the understanding of
    the code.
  - The program code utilises the optimising features of the languages being used.
  - The program code uses language instructions that facilitate the understanding
    op the code.
  - The program code uses language constructs that facilitate the understanding of
    the code.
  - Tables joined in a query are essential to its outcome.
  - The program code uses constructs that preserve the integrity of the data being
    accessed by multiple users and processes.
  - Global data sharing is minimised to enable weak coupling, and modules exhibit
    functional cohesion.
  outcome: 3
