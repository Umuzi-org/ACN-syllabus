## 3. Reports
Good reports are key to making informed decisions. Luckily, there are many tools that will help you organise and visualise the data you've collected.

You've already seen many reports from Google Analytics. You should also familiarise yourself with the reports that are generated by Google Forms. Many of these reports and graphs are generated automatically, but you can also use the data in the spreadsheet of responses to create your own reports.
