title: Measures of Central Tendency - Project
---


We will not only be assessing your code but also how you structure and present your analysis.This [notebook](notebook.ipynb) has a guide to the general structure we expect.

Your repo should contain everything needed to replicate your work. It's good practice to structure your files well, so we'll expect you to have a separate directory for "notebook", so that your final file structure looks something like this:

```
├──notebook
│  └──central_tendency_notebook.ipynb
├──README.md
├──requirements.txt
└──.gitignore 
```

## Instructions

Imagine you have a dataset representing the scores of students in a class. The assignment is to calculate and present key measures of central tendency. 

- Open the central_tendency_notebook notebook you created.
- Declare the dataset for scores using the below list.
```
scores = [80, 60, 78, 79, 48, 95, 90, 87, 100, 89]
```
- Compute and present the Mean, Mode, and Median of the provided scores.


## Submission Guidelines

- Organise your code into well-commented Jupyter notebook cells 
- Include Markdown cells for explanations, analysis, and reflections.
- After completing this project, Push your changes to another branch other than main and open a pull request on github.
