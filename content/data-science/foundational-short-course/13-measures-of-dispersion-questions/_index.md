## Questions

1. How does the range of a dataset change if the highest value increases but the lowest value remains the same? Provide an example illustrating this change.


2. What does a high variance tell you about a dataset? Consider a dataset with a high variance and describe what that might indicate about the values in the dataset.


3. How does the standard deviation help in understanding the consistency of a dataset? Describe a scenario where a small standard deviation is particularly desirable.


4. Under what circumstances might the range be a misleading measure of dispersion? Provide an example where the range does not adequately describe the variability of the dataset.


5. Given two datasets from the same sample space with different variances, what can you infer about the spread of data points in each dataset?


6. How would you interpret the range of salaries within a company? What does a large range tell you, and what additional information might you need to better understand salary distribution?


7. How might the variance of a positively skewed distribution compare to that of a symmetric distribution? Provide examples to illustrate your point.


8. How do outliers affect the standard deviation? Discuss how a single outlier can significantly change the standard deviation of a dataset.


9. Consider a school analyzing test scores for two classes. One class has scores tightly clustered around the mean, while the other has scores spread out over a wide range. How would the measures of dispersion help the school understand the performance of these two classes?


10. In what situations would you prefer to use the standard deviation over the range to describe the dispersion of a dataset? Explain your reasoning with an example.
