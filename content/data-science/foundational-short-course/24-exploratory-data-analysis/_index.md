Data visualization is the graphical representation of data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. It involves creating visual elements such as charts, graphs, and maps to present complex information in a more accessible and understandable format. The goal of data visualization is to communicate information effectively, allowing viewers to grasp concepts, identify patterns, and make data-driven decisions. By using visual representations, data visualization makes it easier to analyze large datasets, detect correlations, and communicate findings to a broader audience.

## Need of Data Visualisation:
- Comprehend the trends and patterns within the data.
- Analyze the frequency and other relevant characteristics of the data.
- Gain insights into the distribution of variables within the dataset.
- Visualize potential relationships between different variables.
