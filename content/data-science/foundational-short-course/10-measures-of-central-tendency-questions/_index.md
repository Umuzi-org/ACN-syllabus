## Questions

1. How do strong statistical skills benefit the various stages of the Data Science Method? Are these skills always necessary, or only in certain situations? 


2. Which central tendency measure is suitable for categorical data, and why?


3. Can the mean sometimes give a misleading view of a dataset? Offer an example where the median might better represent central tendency.


4. How do outliers affect the mean and median differently? Illustrate with a dataset where adding an outlier significantly changes the mean but not the median.


5. When is the mode more insightful than the mean and median? Provide a dataset example where the mode offers the most valuable insight.


6. Consider a set of salaries within a company. If the CEO's salary is included in the dataset, how would this affect the mean salary compared to the median salary? What does this tell you about the distribution of salaries in the company?


7. How can the relationship between the mean, median, and mode help you understand the shape of a dataset's distribution? Describe what the relationship might look like in a positively skewed distribution versus a negatively skewed distribution.


8. Imagine you are analyzing customer review ratings for two products. Product A has ratings that are mostly 4s and 5s, with a few 1s. Product B has ratings evenly distributed from 1 to 5. How might the mean, median, and mode differ in their representation of customer satisfaction for each product?


9. Can a dataset have more than one mode? Provide an example of a multimodal dataset and discuss how multiple modes can influence the interpretation of data.


10. How does the size of a dataset impact the reliability of the mean, median, and mode? Discuss scenarios where increasing the size of the dataset could significantly change one of these measures.
