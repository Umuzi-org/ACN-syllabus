## Exceptions are Valuable

In Java, exceptions are like warning signals that activate when something goes wrong in your code. They are not to be ignored or casually written to a log; instead, they require proper handling.

When your program encounters an issue, it can abruptly halt its execution. Java offers a way to tackle such problems using `try` and `catch` blocks. These blocks assist you in managing errors gracefully, preventing your program from crashing and enabling you to gather information about the encountered issue.

## Common Error Handling Pitfalls

Let's examine some typical mistakes made when handling errors:

- Simply printing errors

```java
try {
  // Code...
} catch (Exception error) {
  System.out.println(error);
}
```

- Printing errors with added formatting

```java
try {
  // Code...
} catch (Exception error) {
  System.out.println("Error: " + error);
}
```

- Returning errors

```java
try {
  // Code...
} catch (Exception error) {
  return error;
}
```

- Catching specific exceptions just to re-throw them without additional context

```java
try {
  // Code...
} catch (IllegalArgumentException error) {
  throw error;
}
```

- Catching and ignoring exceptions

```java
try {
  // Code...
} catch (Exception error) {
  throw new Exception("A new error, possibly unrelated to the caught error");
}
```

## Knowing When to Catch Errors

Understanding when to catch errors is vital. You should only catch errors that you can effectively manage. If you cannot handle the error, it is better to let it propagate up to the caller. This becomes especially critical when developing libraries or modules used by other programmers. Catching an error you cannot handle hides the error from the caller, potentially causing unexpected behaviour and bugs.

## Creating Custom Exceptions

In Java, you can create custom exceptions when you precisely know what went wrong or when you want to provide more context for an existing exception.

There are various ways to throw custom exceptions:

Simply throwing a caught exception or any object as an exception

```java
// AVOID - It does not clearly indicate where the exception occurred, and you can throw almost anything as an exception
throw error;

throw "Some error";

throw new Object();
```

Using the Exception class:

```java
// PREFERRED - It specifies the exception's location and allows you to include a message for clarity
throw new Exception(error);

throw new Exception("Error message");
```
