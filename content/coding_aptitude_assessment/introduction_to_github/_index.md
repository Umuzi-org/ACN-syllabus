title: Basic introduction to Github - Helloworld

Time to learn a little bit about Github.

## Why?

Git and Github are friggin' wonderful. Trust me on this. During your time on this learning journey, you'll be using these wonderful tools a lot.

We don't just use these tools for fun. We use them because Git is an industry standard tool. If you want to have a solid tech career then it'll serve you to have some solid Git skills.

## Learning the basics

Unfortunately for people who are just getting started, Git and Github can feel pretty weird.

The first thing you need to understand is that Github is a bit like cloud storage for your files. You can create things called "repositories" (or "repos" for short) that are like directories/folders in which you can store things.

The first thing you need to learn is how to create a new repo and upload some files there. If you can get that right then we are good to go :)

[This little tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) will teach you the basics.

## Check yourself

The tutorial covers a lot of different things. The main things you'll need to be able to do for now are:

- create a new repository
- upload files to the main branch

As you progress in your career it will be useful to know a whole lot more, but for now we just need you to be able to submit your coding assignments.

## Going forward

Up next we'll be asking you to do a bunch of projects. We will create a repo for each of your projects and we will invite you to collaborate on those repos.

It's really really important that you keep an eye on your email inbox. If you get a Github invitation from us then you will need to accept that invitation otherwise you wont be able to submit your work.

Please upload your code into the repos we provide. We wont be using branches and pull requests or anything fancy like that for now. Just upload your work into the `main` branches of the repos.
