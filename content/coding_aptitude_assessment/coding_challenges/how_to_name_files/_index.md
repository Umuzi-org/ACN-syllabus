title: IMPORTANT!! Naming your files and functions
---

This is **REALLY IMPORTANT!**

**Good coders pay close attention to detail and read specifications properly.**


We use a bot to mark these projects. The bot requires that your code is laid out in a very specific way. If your code is not laid out in this way then the bot will mark the code as incorrect.

But don't panic :) The code layout is very straight-forward.

## Python

If you are doing the coding challenge in Python then you should make a separate file for each task. The files should be named according to the following pattern:

Task 1 should be in a file named `task1.py`, task 2 should be in a file named `task2.py`, etc.

The files should be in the root directory of your repo. You should not have any extra directories. In other words, all your task files should be in the same directory as the README.md file that was automatically created in your repo.

Each task will require that you write a single function. Please name the functions according to the same convention as the files.

Task 1's function should be named `task1` (so you will start off by writing `def task1(`), and task 2's function should be named `task2`, etc.

## Javascript

If you are doing the coding challenges in Javascript then you should make a separate file for each task. The files should be named according to the following pattern:

Task 1 should be in a file named `task1.js`, task 2 should be in a file named `task2.js`

The files should be in the root directory of your repo. You should not have any extra directories. In other words, all your task files should be in the same directory as the README.md file that was automatically created in your repo.

Each task will require that you write a single function. Please name the functions according to the same convention as the files.

Task 1's function should be named `task1`  (so you will start off by writing `function task1(`), and task 2's function should be named `task2`, etc.

### Exports

> This is only necessary for JavaScript developers.

This is also very important. If you don't do this then the bot wont be able to access your functions!

At the end of every one of your task files you need to `export` the function. You do this by including an export statement like this.

```
module.exports = { YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME };
```

So for task 1, you will create a file named task1.js. Inside that file you will have the following:

```
function task1(){
    // YOUR FUNCTION CODE
}

module.exports = { task1 };

```
