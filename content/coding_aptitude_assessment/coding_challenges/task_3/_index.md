title: 'Coding aptitude assessment challenge: Task 3'
---

Write a function that takes in a single number. It should `return` the string `even` if the number is even, and the string `odd` if the number is odd.

Example usage:

- `task3(44)` should return `even`
- `task3(1)` should return `odd`

## Did you know that...

Most self-taught coders don't know the difference between print and return. Make sure that you understand the difference. It really matters a lot if you want to build anything significant.

## Check your understanding!

- what does it mean for a function to `return` something?
- how is `return` different from printing?
- would you know how to write a function that tells if a number is divisible by 6?
