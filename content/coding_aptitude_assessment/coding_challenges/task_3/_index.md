title: 'Coding aptitude assessment challenge: Task 3'
---

Write a function that takes in a single number. It should return the string `even` if the number is even, and `odd` if the number is odd.

For example:

`task3(44)` should return `"even"`
`task3(1)` should return `"odd"`

## Did you know that...

Most self taught coders don't know the difference between print and return. Make sure that you understand the difference. It really matters a lot if you want to build anything significant.
