Write a function that takes in three numbers. These numbers represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The function should return the area of a triangle.

This article will explain how to do it https://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-the-Area-of-a-Triangle

Make sure your function works with floating point inputs. Eg:

```
task4(1.2, 2, 3.5)
```
