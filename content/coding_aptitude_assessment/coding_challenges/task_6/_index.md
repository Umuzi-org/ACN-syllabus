title: 'Coding aptitude assessment challenge: Task 6'
---

Write a function that can take in any number of numbers. It should return the maximum number.

Do this without using built-in methods. Write your own logic from scratch.

Again, the function should expect a bunch of numbers as input, not an array or list.

```
task6([1,2,44,3])  // BAD
task6(1,2,44,3)    // GOOD
```

## Check your understanding

- what kinds of loops do you know of? What are they for? How do they differ?
- will your code work if there are 50 numbers passed into your function?
- will it work if there are negative and positive numbers passed in?
- can it handle the number zero?
