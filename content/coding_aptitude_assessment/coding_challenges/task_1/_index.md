Write a function that simply **prints** the string "Hello World!".

## Javascript

If you have been asked to do these tasks in JavaScript then you must use the `console.log` function to print the string.

For example:

```
console.log("something")
```

## Python

If you are using Python then you should be using `print` to print the string.

```
print("something")   # so this kind of thing

print "don't do this"  # if you are writing print statements like this
                      # then you are using the wrong version of Python. Please
                      # make sure you have Python 3 installed.
```


## Java 

If you are using Java then you should be using `System.out.println` to print the string.

For example:

```
System.out.println("something");
```

## Have some videos :)

Since this is your first code project we'll walk you through the process of getting to complete.  You'll need to do the future projects on your own though :)

### Part 1: Submitting your code

Some learners will be moving to alternate programs following this, but as long as you are still in tech, your understanding of Git and Github will be extremely important.

### Part 2: Addressing review feedback

## Check your understanding! 

- What does it mean to "print"?
- What is a function? 
- What does it mean to call a function?
- What is a string? How does that compare to integers?
- Can you run your own code? Does it work?
- What is a function argument?
