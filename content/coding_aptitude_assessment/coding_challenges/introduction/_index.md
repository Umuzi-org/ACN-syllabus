title: Introduction to coding challenges
---

It's time to write some code :)

This is how the challenges work:

1. When you choose to start one of your coding challenges (by clicking on the `Start Project` button on your board), we will create a new github repo for you. If you start 5 coding challenges then you'll have 5 repos.
2. To submit your code, just upload it into the main branch of the correct repo, don't make any directories or branches. Make sure you add your task 1 code into the repo that was created for task 1.

We have a bot ü§ñ that plugs into the repos we create. It will mark your work and it will tell you if your code works or not.

If your code doesn't work then you can try again as many times as you want üòÑ

## Critical ‚ö†Ô∏è

Bots are pretty stupid so if you put your code in the wrong place it will tell you that your code doesn't work. So you need to be very careful about naming things EXACTLY as required. This should be very easy to get right, it just takes a little bit of attention to detail.

**Good coders pay close attention to detail and read specifications properly.**

## What order should you do things in?

We have organized the tasks from the easiest to the hardest. So it would make sense to try to do them in order. But you can really do them in whatever order you want.

## Your final score

Your final score will be calculated according to how many tasks you finish. That means that if the code doesn't do what it is meant to then it doesn't count.

If you get feedback on a task it would be really good for you to address that feedback and resubmit that project before starting anything else.

By addressing feedback as quickly as possible you learn as quickly as possible. And learning from feedback will stop you from making the same mistakes over and over.

Good luck!
