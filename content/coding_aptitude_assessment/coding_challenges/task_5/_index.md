title: 'Coding aptitude assessment challenge: Task 5'
---

Write a function that takes in three numbers and returns the maximum number.

Do this without using any built-in methods. Write your own logic from scratch.

The function should expect a 3 numbers, not an array or list.

```
task5([1,2,3])  // BAD - this function accepts an array/list which is wrong
task5(1,2,3)  // GOOD - this accepts three numbers just like we need it to.
```
