Make a function to convert any number into hours and minutes. It should return a string showing the numbers of hours and minutes.

Here are some sample inputs and outputs:

- 71 will return “1 hour, 11 minutes"
- 133 will return “2 hours, 13 minutes"
- 1 will return "0 hours, 1 minute"


**Most people get this question wrong!**

Coders are precise so it is important to focus here. The output should show the number of hours and minutes, and it should make proper use of singulars and plurals.
