title: Get started with Hackerrank
---

Hackerrank is a great resource for self-testing and leveling up your problem solving abilities.

There are lots of reasons to work on your problem solving abilities:

Firstly, it really helps you to be a better coder. Hard problems become easy. So you can do hard things, and you can do them fast. This is wonderful.

The other big thing is job interviews.

When you go for job interviews as a coder, employers will often expect you to solve some coding puzzles. Generally this will be like a timed test, you wont be allowed to copy-paste other people's solutions, you wont be able to try to get answers out of YouTube, you'll just have to solve the puzzle. It can be a pretty high pressure situation.

I once had to solve a whole lot of tricky problems with 3 senior technical staff members looming over me at the same time. True story. It was ok though, I'd even say it was fun. Because I was prepared.

When it comes to leveling up your problem solving abilities, the earlier you start the better. The tricks you learn by completing Hackerrank problems will just make your life better.
