title: Platform Engineering
---

A team of engineers focused on improving the software development experience by helping developers to be self-sufficient. 

Platform engineers are responsible for gathering the most common software patterns and practices used across their organisation and use that knowledge to design and develop a product, usually referred as an “Internal Developer Platform”, used as a foundational building block for development teams.

Simply stating, “DevOps teams” usually focus on CI/CD pipelines, but an Internal Developer Platform should include the whole software development process, including features like: managing environment variables and flag features, adding services and dependencies, managing access, troubleshooting and rolling back, creating entire new environments, scaling up and down, connecting with other internal and third-party services etc.

Aims for the golden rule: **you build it, you run it**.
