This course takes 15 hours in total. Spread it out over a few days. If you try to get through it all in one go you won't absorb very much.

## Managing your schedule

This course takes some time and doing it all in one go will not make sense because then you won't learn the material well. When you start this card, assume you will be working on this course for no more than three hours per day.

This course takes approximately 15 hours to complete. If you do three hours per day, then you should finish in a week.

## Submission instruction

When you have completed the course, take a screenshot of the completion message and upload it to your google drive. Once it has been uploaded, submit the link of the upload to your Tilde card.
It's very *important* that you make sure your link is set to public so it can be accessible to everyone.
It should look like this:
