DEPRECATED

When interviewing for a job, it's really important to show up looking like you are there to do business. But sometimes choosing the right clothes can be hard.

This project exists so that you can test drive your outfit and get some feedback. We want you to go to your interview looking calm and confident.

## Instructions

Choose a few different outfits you think will go down well. You might be wearing your own clothes, or you might need to borrow something.

Get a few photos of each outfit. If you are taking photos yourself make use of a full length mirror. Otherwise get a friend or family member to help.

Upload your photos to a google drive folder, and name them well. Eg: "outfit_1_front.jpg", "outfit_1_back.jpg", "outfit_2_front.jpg".

Submit a link to your google drive folder.

## Instructions for reviewer

- if you get a permission denied error when you access the link, then add a RED FLAG review
- if you think at least one outfit will work, add a "competent" review and say which picture you liked
- if none of the outfits are ok, then add a "not yet competent" review and give a bit of feedback

Please add comments and advice. Eg: "I like outfit 1, but the tie is a bit much" or "this is a job interview, not a funeral!", or "I would hire you now if I could! I like all the outfits, but number 3 is the best", or "You should be wearing shoes".

Help each other out, and have fun :)
