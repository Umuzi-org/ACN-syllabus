title: Volkerdon Practice Assessments
---

More practice tests, when taking the examination we often find that the practice tests offered in the Scrum Open are not sufficient to test whether you will actually pass or not, in this section you will be focusing on getting yourself test ready by writing multiple practice examinations. You want to aim for high scores under actual test conditions.

Complete the [Volkerdon practice assessments](https://www.volkerdon.com/bundles/agile-scrum-mock-exam) once you have completed it upload a screenshot showing that it is complete to your Google Drive and submit.
