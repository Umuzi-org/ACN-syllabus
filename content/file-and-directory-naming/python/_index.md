## How should I name my Python modules and packages?

When naming files and directories in Python, you should use small letters and underscores to separate your words.
This type of naming convention is called snake_case and is also used in naming Python variable and function names.

### Do you think you've got it?

#### Directories

Based on the above guidelines, which of the following is a good way to name a Python directory?

```
  - apyhthondirectory

  - a_python_directory

  - a-python-directory

  - APYTHONDIRECTORY

  - ApythonDirectory
```

We are curious as to what your answer was!
See below for some tips in naming your directories.

```
  - good_directory_name

  - bad-directory-name

  - AnotherBadDirectoryName

  - AVERYBADDIRECTORYNAME

  - nevernameyourdirectorylikethis
```

```
- task.python

- task-1.1.py
