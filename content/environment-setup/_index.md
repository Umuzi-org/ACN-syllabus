title: Getting set up to write code on your device
---

You'll need to be set up so that you can write and run code on your own device. There are a few options here.

Please follow the appropriate link:

## If you have a computer

Please follow the instructions below based on the language you are going to be using.

If you are here for web dev, you'll be learning JavaScript, if you are here for Data Science or Data Engineering you'll be doing Python. And if you are doing our Java course, follow the Java instructions.

## If you have an Android device

If you don't have a computer you can use then you can use your phone. Here's how to get set up on an Android.

You'll need to install Acode: This is where you will edit your code: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.foxdebug.acodefree&hl=en_ZA

Using ACode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZAc-imlq88 This video focuses on JavaScript, but don't panic if you are doing something else. The editor can be used to write all sorts of things.

## If you have an iPhone

Eish, we haven't managed to find anything good here. If you have any suggestions please bring them up. You can even submit a PR, we'll all be very impressed.

## If you don't have the gear you need

Do your best to find a solution on your own

- Ask your friends and family if you can borrow something.
- See if you can find an internet cafe and try make a deal.
- See if there are any co-working spaces near you that have computers available.
- See if you can make a plan with someone who refurbishes computers for a living, sometimes you can pick up gear very cheaply.
