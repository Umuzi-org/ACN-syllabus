There are loads of different kinds of programmers, and each type needs to know a different set of tools, practices and languages. If you spend some time Googling "What programming language should I learn first" then you'll get lots of confusing and conflicting advice. 

## So why start with web dev?

Overall, learning web development is a great investment in your future, offering a range of career opportunities, creative outlets, and personal growth potential.

### There is a high demand for web developers 

As more and more businesses go online, the demand for web developers continues to grow. Web development is one of the fastest-growing fields in tech. This means that there are plenty of job opportunities available for skilled web developers.

### It's a versatile skill set  

Web development skills can be used in a variety of settings, from small startups to large corporations, and can be applied to a wide range of projects, from creating websites for local businesses to developing complex web applications for multinational organizations. This versatility means that you can choose to specialize in an area that interests you or work on a variety of projects throughout your career.

### You get to be creative 

Web development is a highly creative field that allows you to design and build websites and applications that are not only functional but also visually appealing. This means that you can use your creativity to make a positive impact on the user experience and create websites that stand out from the crowd.

And even if you don't consider yourself to be "creative" when it comes to making visual things, there are lots of different kinds of creativity. When you start to build serious projects you would need to solve all kinds of problems in creative ways. It can be a lot of fun!

### There are a lot of remote work opportunities

Web development is a field that lends itself well to remote work, meaning that you can work from anywhere in the world with an internet connection. This can be a great advantage if you are looking for flexibility and work-life balance.
