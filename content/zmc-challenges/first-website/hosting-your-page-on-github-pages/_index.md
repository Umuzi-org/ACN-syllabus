title: Hosting your website on the web
---

In this project, you are going to take the `index.html` page you made in the previous step and turn it into an actual website. You'll be using a thing called Github pages to get this right.

## Introduction to GitHub

GitHub is a web-based platform that handles a lot of things that are important to coders. It does quite a lot of different things, but we're just going to get into the basics for now.

### Github as cloud storage

If you work hard to write some code on your computer and then your computer breaks then all your hard work would be gone. That would be terrible. The first bit of value Github gives you is free backups. 

You can upload your code to GitHub and it'll keep it safe for you. It will even keep track of different versions of your code. This becomes useful if you work on big projects with multiple people.

### Free hosting 

GitHub has a cool feature called Github pages. If you upload your code then Github will turn your code into a live website. Your website will get a nice free URL, and anyone with an internet connection would be able to visit that URL to see your work. So cool!

## Instructions

Here we go:

### 1. Create an account 

Go to [the Github website](https://github.com/) and create an account. 

**Important:** When choosing a Github username be sure you choose something nice and memorable. You can use your real name or something playful, it doesn't matter too much. 

### 2. Create a repo 

Repo is short for repository. You can think of it as a folder or directory. 

Follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) to create a repository for your website. 

- Give the repo a sensible name. Eg: my-first-website 
- make sure you mark the repo as "public" and not "private" This is very important (step 4)
- Initialize the repo with a README (step 5)

From now on you'll be able to interact with your repo by navigating to it in your browser.

If your username is `mysteryElephant320` and your repo name is `first-website` then you would be able to see your repo at: `https://github.com/mysteryElephant320/first-website`

Make sure you can find your repo whenever you want to.
### 3. Upload your index.html file 

In the previous step of this challenge, you made an HTML file called `index.html`. Follow [this  guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository) to upload it to your repo.

The guide might have a few confusing words. I'll define them briefly here:

- commit: Every time you make a change to your code on Github, then Github will keep track of what changed. You'll forever have access to every version of your code. Commit is just a special word for version. 
- commit message: Every time you make a new version of your code you're making a commit. Every commit can have a message. That way when you look over your version history you can see what you did when. This gets useful on big projects or when you are working on a team because you will be able to see the whole history of the project.

You'll be asked if you want to add your code to the main branch or if you want to create a new branch. Branches are cool, trust me, but we aren't going to get into them right now.  Just choose "main branch" 

Once you have filled in the form you can save your changes by clicking on the "commit" button.

### 4. Check that you uploaded your file correctly

Navigate to your repo and make sure you can see a file named `index.html`. Make sure that the contents are what they should be.  You can click on the file to see what is inside.

### 5. Set up GitHub pages 

You'll now use Github pages to host your website on the web. 

Github pages are a really powerful thing and they can be configured to do all kinds of cool stuff. We're going to use the simplest setup possible :) 

[This guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site) will take you through the process.

You'll be asked to choose a publishing source. You'll just use the main branch and the root directory.

### 6. View your live website 

Once you have set your website up you'll be able to visit it in your browser.

If your repo is available at `https://github.com/mysteryElephant320/first-website`, then your webpage will be available at `https://mysteryElephant320.github.io/first-website/`.

Navigate to your website. Does it look the way you expected? 

**Note:** Sometimes it can take a few minutes for the website to go live. If it's not working then wait a few minutes and check again.

### 7. Submit your work 

Once your website is up and running you can submit this project.

Please submit the link to your live website by using the **Project Submission** form. 

### 8. Wait a while...

Once you have handed in your work then we'll mark it. It'll take a few minutes.  If you followed the instructions then you'll get a positive review and you'll get to move on to the next step. 

If you didn't follow instructions or you missed something then you'll be given feedback about what to fix. If there is something to fix then:

- edit your `index.html` file on your device and sort out **ALL** the problems
- upload the new file to your GitHub repo 
- make sure that your website reflects the changes
- resubmit your code for review

**Note:** You won't be allowed to continue to the next step until ALL the changes have been addressed.
