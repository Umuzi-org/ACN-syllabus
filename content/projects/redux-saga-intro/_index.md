title: Redux Saga Intro
---

Write a simple game using React and Redux saga.

Take a look at this tutorial as inspiration: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-snake-game-with-react-redux-and-redux-sagas/#what-is-redux-saga-why-are-we-using-it

## Game requirements

The goal of this project is to build a simple game. It should be around as simple as Snake. But we wont be building snake :)

The game should have the following elements:

1. An avatar / main character / hero (whatever you want to call it)
2. The avatar can be moved around the screen by using the arrow keys on your keyboard. If you are a gamer then you might want to use the "wasd" keys to move around
3. Something to collect in order to get points. The points need to be displayed
4. A way to die or lose the game

There are a few options for number 4. Here are some ideas:
- maybe if a monster gets you then you die (or lose some health points)
- maybe you die if you don't gather points quickly enough
- maybe there is something shooting at you and you have to dodge
- maybe there is some kind of time limit involved
- maybe there is some kind of obstacle you need to navigate
- maybe there are physics involved (jumping, falling, etc)

Try not to go overboard with the game mechanics. Implement one thing at a time.

## The looks

Your game doesn't need to win any awards in terms of looks. There are lots of places where you can download free game elements and art. Or if you are the arty type you are welcome to make your own thing.

## Project submission

Please update your README file to include:

- a video of your game
- any special instructions for playing the game
- instructions on how to set your game up on someone else's computer

## Technical requirements

You need to use React, redux and redux-saga. Your code needs to be clean and beautiful as always.

Please test your code!
