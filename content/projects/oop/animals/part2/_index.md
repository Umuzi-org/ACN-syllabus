In this challenge you will update your current Animals project and add unit tests to the project

## Project structure

### Java

The code you push to git should have the following structure:

```
├── build.gradle
├── gradle
│   └── wrapper
│       ├── gradle-wrapper.jar
│       └── gradle-wrapper.properties
├── gradlew
├── gradlew.bat
├── settings.gradle
└── src
    ├── main
    |   └── java
    |       ├── Animal.java       <-------- names are important
    |       ├── Cat.java          <-------- names are important
    |       ├── Dog.java          <-------- names are important
    |       ├── Home.java         <-------- names are important
    |       └── MainProgram.java  <-------- names are important
    └── test
        └── java
            ├── CatTest.java   <-------- names are important
            └── DogTest.java   <-------- names are important
            ... other logical things
```

### JavaScript

Your directory structure should look like this.

```
    >node_modules    <---- make sure this is in your .gitignore
    >spec
        > support
            - jasmine.json
        - animals_spec.js
    >src
        - animals.js
    - package.json
```

## Instructions

### For Java

You'll be using JUnit.

1. Create a class called `AnimalTests`
2. Update `Animal` super class `eats()` function to return a String, "Food".
3. Update `Dog` class `sounds()` function to return a `String`, "Bark".
4. Update `Cat` class `sounds()` function to return a `String`, "Meow".

```
// Java

Dog dog = new Dog()

dog.eats()    // -> 'Food'
dog.sounds() // -> 'Bark'

Cat cat = new Cat()

cat.eats()    // -> 'Food'
cat.sounds() // -> 'Meow'
```

Now let's add our first JUnit test to our `AnimalTests`. The class should have the following methods `TestDogSound()`, `TestDogEats()`, `TestCatSound()` and `TestCatEats()`.Each method should have the @Test tag placed above it. The tests should work as follows.

```
// Java

//Dog Tests
Test -> Does dog eat Food should Pass
Test -> Does dog eat food should Fail

//Cat Tests
Cat cat = new Cat();
Test -> Does cat Bark should Fail
Test -> Does cat Meow should Pass
Test -> Does cat eat meat should Fail
Test -> Does cat eat Food should Pass
Test -> Does cat eat food should Fail

```

### For JavaScript

Use Jasmine to test your code.

1. Update `Animal` super class `eats()` method to return a String, "Food".
2. Update `Dog` class `sounds()` method to return a `String`, "Bark".
3. Update `Cat` class `sounds()` method to return a `String`, "Meow".
4. Make sure the `makeAllSounds()` method still works properly.

```
// JavaScript

Dog dog = new Dog()

dog.eats()    // -> 'Food'
dog.sounds() // -> 'Bark'

Cat cat = new Cat()

cat.eats()    // -> 'Food'
cat.sounds() // -> 'Meow'
```

Then create tests for your `eats()` and `sounds()` methods on the `Dog` and `Cat` classes with Jasmine.

```
// JavaScript

//Dog Tests
let dog = new Dog();
Test -> Does dog eat Food should Pass
Test -> Does dog eat food should Fail
Test -> Does dog Roar should Fail
Test -> Does dog Bark should Pass

//Cat Tests
let cat = new Cat();
Test -> Does cat Bark should Fail
Test -> Does cat Meow should Pass
Test -> Does cat eat meat should Fail
Test -> Does cat eat Food should Pass
Test -> Does cat eat food should Fail

```

### Up for a Challenge?

This section is not compulsory. If you do this we'll think you're cool.

Add some extra tests for your Home class. Make sure that it makes all the right noises. And that you can't adopt the same pet twice.
