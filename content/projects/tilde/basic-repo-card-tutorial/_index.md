---

There are a few kinds of projects you can do and they can be submitted in different ways. In this tutorial, you'll see how to get a repository project to complete.

## Start the project

If you have not yet clicked the "start project" button for this card, do so now. You'll see the card move to In Progress.

It might take a few seconds to move. The reason for this is that a whole lot of things are happening in the background.

- A Github repository is created for you to work on. This is a private repository, so only certain people can see it
- You are added as a "collaborator" on the repo so you have access.

Now explore the card. Click on the Details button and see what's there.


## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### I get a 404 error when I try to access my repo

When you are added to a repository as a collaborator, then Github sends you an invitation via personal email. Your GitHub account is associated with your email address. You must monitor that email address.

If you don't accept the invitation then you don't get access to the repository.

### Why can't I just give you a link to my work?


I admit it might feel a little weird at first, but you'll get the hang of it :)

## Instructions

If you look at the project details you'll see that a repository has been created for you. Please click on the link and visit the repository page on Github.

For now, you can interact with Github using the user interface. You don't need to worry about using git from the command line or anything fancy like that. Not just yet anyway. In future projects, you'll become a Git command-line ninja. For now, we just need you to see how Tilde and Github play together.

### 1. Create a few files

Open up your text editor of choice and create a markdown file. This is a plain text file. Name it `important.md`.

Write down the answer to the following question:

What is more important: rushing to complete as many cards as possible? Or making sure you fully understand the work? And Why?

### 2. Upload the file

Use the Github user interface (website) to upload your file into the repository. Make sure that you can see the file in Github when you look at your repo's files.

### 3. Ask for a review (on Tilde)

Now go to your Tilde board and click on the "Request Review" button on the project card. You'll see the card move across to the Review column.

### That's all :)

By putting your card in the "review" column you are basically saying that you believe that the main branch of your repo meets all the project requirements and is ready for a competence review.
