In this tutorial, you'll see how to get a "continue repo" project to complete.

## Start the project

Now explore the card. Click on the Details button and see what's there.

*You'll notice that the repo attached to this card is something you have worked with before.*

## Make a new Pull Request and get it merged

- Make a new branch
- Edit and add a bit more text to the markdown file you created previously.
- Make a new Pull Request
- Get it merged

## Move your card to the REVIEW column (AFTER YOUR PULL REQUEST IS MERGED! NOT BEFORE!)

This will feel very familiar. Do what it takes to get your card complete.
