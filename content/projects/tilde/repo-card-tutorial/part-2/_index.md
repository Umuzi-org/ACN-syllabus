In this tutorial, you'll see how to get a "continue repo" project to complete.

## Start the project

Now explore the card. Click on the Details button and see what's there.

*You'll notice that the repo attached to this card is something you have worked with before.*

## Make a new Pull Request and get it merged

- Make a new branch
- Edit and add a bit more text to the markdown file you created previously.
- Make a new Pull Request
- Get it merged

## Move your card to the REVIEW column (AFTER YOUR PULL REQUEST IS MERGED! NOT BEFORE!)

This will feel very familiar. Do what it takes to get your card to the complete column.
