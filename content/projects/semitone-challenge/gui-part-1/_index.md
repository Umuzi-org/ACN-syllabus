Create a basic web site that a user can use to interact with the JamBuddy class.

If you are required to do this in a web framework then do so, otherwise create a simple `index.html` page that a user can just open in their browser.

- Make a button with the text "Get random notes". If the user clicks on this button then the `selectNotes` function should be called and the notes should be displayed on the screen.
- make an input box where the user can enter their answer.
- create a button with the text "Submit answer". If the user clicks this button then the `checkAnswer` function should be called.
  - if the answer is correct then display the message "You got it right .Well Done!"
  - if the answer is incorrect then display the message "Wrong answer! Try again"

## Acceptance criteria

### Directory structure

Please put your html in a file called index.html in your root directory.

### DOM Manipulation

DOM Manipulation is very useful when it comes modifying the content, structure or styling of an HTML page.

### Unit tests

TDD is a must. Yes, you need to even unit test your DOM manipulations.

When testing your dom, don't just check that your boring html exists. Make sure that when the "Get random notes" button is clicked then the right dom elements get updated. Tests do not exist to take up space, they exist to make sure your code actually works.
In your tests you can use the document.addEventListener() method to check if a button has been clicked e.g.
```
//create a var and assign in with the html button element using the id
let button = document.getElementById("btn");
let notesDiv = document.getElementById("displayNotes").innerHTML;
//create an onclick event with the clickable button
button.addEventListener("Click", function(){
  //assign the div with random notes
  notesDiv.innerHTML = buddy.selectNotes();
})
// the notes div should not be empty after the click event, so expect it not to be empty
expect(notesDiv.innerHTML).not.toBe("")
```

### Make it look reasonably good

We don't need you to win any design awards here, but put some effort into the looks. If you make anyone's eyes bleed that would be a problem.

Here are a few tools you might want to explore:

- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#using-tailwind-via-cdn) Just use the CDN to keep it simple for now
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/)

You can also do your own styling from scratch.

Also, think about the user! Imagine a musician using this thing in order to learn music. If your site is confusing then people wouldn't use it. They'd just get annoyed and leave. 

**Bad UX is a bug!** Make sure your user knows how to use your application. Make it dead obvious.
