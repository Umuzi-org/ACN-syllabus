## Set up your environment

### Javascript

Please test your code using jasmine.

Your directory structure should look like this.

```
    >node_modules    <---- make sure this is in your .gitignore
    >spec
        > support
            -jasmine.json
        - password_is_valid_spec.js
        - password_is_ok_spec.js
    >src
        - password_checker.js
    - package.json
```

### Python

Your project is expected to be completed using pytest. You are expected to follow industry best practices in all things. This means that you need to have a directory structure that is in good shape. Please name your files and folders like this:

```
├── password_checker   the package under test
│   └── password_checker.py
├── requirements.txt    installation requiremnts
├── setup.py            installation script for the package under test
└── tests               all package tests go in this directory
    ├── test_password_is_valid.py
    └── test_password_is_ok.py
```

Please take a look at this topic to see an explanation of the required directory structure.

### Java

The code you push to git should have the following structure:

```
├── build.gradle
├── gradle
│   └── wrapper
│       ├── gradle-wrapper.jar
│       └── gradle-wrapper.properties
├── gradlew
├── gradlew.bat
├── settings.gradle
└── src
    ├── main
    |   └── java
    |       └── PasswordChecker.java <-------- names are important
    └── test
        └── java
            └── ???.java             <-------- names are important
```

Please refer to the following to find out more: {{% contentlink path="topics/java-specific/project-submission-requirements" %}}

## Instructions

Implement the following function by following a TDD methodology:

```
// Javascript:
passwordIsValid(password)
```

```
// Java:
passwordIsValid(password)
```

```
# Python:
password_is_valid(password)
```

`password_is_valid` will check if the password meets a few different conditions. If one of the below conditions is not met then the relevant error/exception should be thrown/raised. Your error/exception message should match one of the following conditions exactly (word-for-word).

1. password should exist
2. password should be longer than than 8 characters
3. password should have at least one lowercase letter
4. password should have at least one uppercase letter
5. password should at least have one digit
6. password should have at least one special character
7. password should have at least one whitespace character

In the case of (6) above, a special character is a character that is on the keyboard but is not a number or letter. Eg `{ % & * " '` etc

Next, implement a function called "password strength":

```
// Javascript:
passwordStrength(password)
```

```
// Java:
passwordStrength(password)
```

```
# Python:
password_strength(password)
```

This function should count the number of conditions met and then return a string that describes the strength of the password. Valid strings are "invalid", "weak","medium" and "strong".

- If number of conditions met >= 6: return "strong"
- If number of conditions met >= 4: return "medium"
- If number of conditions met >= 3: return "weak"
- If conditions 1 or 2 are not met: return "invalid"

## Note on DRY code

Please don't re-implement the same check in two different places. Good code is DRY. Every piece of knowledge should be represented once in your code.

## Instructions for reviewers

1. **Conditions** - There are 7 conditions above, so make sure that all conditions are being used for both of the functions passwordIsValid and PasswordStrength. 
2. **Error messages** - Make sure the passwordIsValid function should throw the relevant error messages and should match the 7 conditions above (word-for-word). The error messages can all be used in an object and be called from the tests and functions.
3. **Count conditions and what to return** - For passwordStrength function, if condition 1 and 2 is not met and all the other conditions are met then the function should return Invalid. e.g. if I pass in this password P@ssw 12 then the function should return Invalid cause condition 2 is not met password should be longer than 8 characters.
4. **Testing** - Make sure that the spec file contains multiple test cases that are not short and check if every condition is working correctly for both functions and the relevant error messages are used. The tests should prove that the functions are working correctly and the code cannot break. e.g.
`P$$12 A` should fail for both functions, for PasswordIsValid the relevant error message should be thrown and for passwordStrength `Invalid` should be returned.
