## We would like to get to know you better

We have a few questions for you. Please answer each of them in a separate MARKDOWN file.

We also want you to know yourself better. A lot of people don't really sit down and think about what they are trying to do in the long run. What their own success looks like and what might get in the way of their success. The questions in this exercise are designed to help you define and reach your goals.

### The questions

Please create a separate file for each of these. Please use the question number as a part of each file name.

Remember to pay attention to your sentence structure, spelling and grammar. If you need a little help with your grammar, [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) is a really useful service. Being able to communicate clearly and professionally in text is a super power.
