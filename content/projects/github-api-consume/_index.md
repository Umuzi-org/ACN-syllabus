title: Consume Github API
---

In this project you'll make use of Github's awesome API. We chose Github for this project because:

- you are already familiar with Github
- The api is really well documented
- the api is solidly built and a lot of people use it

## Instructions

First, get familiar with consuming apis from the command line. Play with this. [Getting started with the Github API V3](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/getting-started/).

Remember, `curl` is your friend. And so is `man`. (try typing in `man curl` at the command line)

Now, in your language of choice (not bash, use Java, Python or Js) write a function with the input arguments:
- owner
- repository name
- start date
- end date

The function should output a list or array of pull requests on the repo such that the PRs were created, updated, merged or closed between the given two dates.
For each PR include the `id`, `user` (who opened the PR), `title`, `state`, and when it was created.
While for private repos a token will be required, the function should be able to work on public repos (eg. [ACN-syllabus](https://github.com/Umuzi-org/ACN-syllabus)) without needing a token.

Please be sure to follow the standard naming conventions for your language.

### Instructions for reviewers
- Ensure that the function works with any github User and repository name, meaning that the function should not only work with one User/repo name. 
- Ensure that the function prints for JavaScript and for python the function should return the output.
- Ensure that the correct error/exception messages are used when trying to handle errors, if an incorrect user or repo was passed in a function call then the error messages should be explicit e.g. `Error 404 User or Repo Not Found`.
- Ensure that the output is a list/array and depending on the dates passed in, If there were no open, closed, updated or merged PR's between the two dates an empty array/list should be printed out.
