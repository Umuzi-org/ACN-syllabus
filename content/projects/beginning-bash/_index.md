It's important to understand a bit about the command-line if you want to be a professional coder. There are a few reasons for this:

1. Professional coders usually use Git for version control. If you are not comfortable with the command line then there is a limit to what you can do
2. A lot of command-line understanding is transferrable to other situations
3. If you ever deploy your code onto the internet you're likely to need to use bash commands to interact with the devices running your code. 

## Getting started 

The first step is to open the command line or terminal on your device:

- If you are running Android, then open your termux app
- If you are running Windows, then:
  Open your Git shell OR
  using [linux subsystem for windows](https://itsfoss.com/install-bash-on-windows/), just open your Linux terminal
- If you are using Mac or Linux, just open your terminal

If this is the first time you've ever opened such a program, DON'T PANIC! You'll get used to this thing.

Now you'll need to learn a few basic commands to get by:
