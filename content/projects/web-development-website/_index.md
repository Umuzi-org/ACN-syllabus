title: Web Development - Build your first personal website
---

Now that you have finished creating your first simple personal portfolio, make it responsive and ensure that it passes through a linter. You should make changes to the same portfolio you have created, do not make a new one.

## Instructions

The HTML and CSS should be developed in a logical way with good naming conventions that would allow another developer to easily understand and build upon your code. There is something called "Semantic Markup" - read all about it [here](https://seekbrevity.com/semantic-markup-important-web-design/).

You can also make use of this cool [markup validation tool](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate the HTML code used in your website.

Your web page files and folders should be organized and named in a logical manner.

Once you have finished your design and are satisfied with the style and content, please submit a link of the website hosted on GitHub Pages. You must have hosted your simple portfolio to [Github Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) by now, please submit the same link of your website with the updated features. DO NOT submit a link to your github repo. We don't want to clone your website, we want to look at what you built.

### Requirements

- Website must be responsive to different screen sizes - use a mobile-first approach!
  - Use CSS Grid (see tutorials below) to design your site and make it responsive.
- Website must be developed using HTML and CSS Grid with a logical structure and naming conventions in your code.
- You can also add some Javascript to make things more interactive.
- Feel free to use icons, colours, pictures or organograms if you need to.
- Make sure that your html passes through a [linter](https://validator.w3.org/). It is important to reduce errors and improve the overall quality of your code.
- Start small and simple. Get the basic structure in first. Don't sit and obsess over choosing the right shade of green, or the perfect font.
- Also, we'll be looking out for good developer habits. Please make sure you push your code often and your git commit messages actually make sense!
- Try to avoid fancy flowery language, it's actually more impressive when people get straight to the point. Communicate clearly and efficiently.
- Demonstrate attention to detail. Make sure your stuff is tidy. Use whitespace as needed. Make sure your pictures are not squashed or stretched.
- This is not a creative writing exercise. Please tell the truth about your abilities and experience. If you did not do a job then do not list it.
