## Assignment

We will predict employee salaries from different employee characteristics (or features).
Import the data [salary.csv](salary.csv) to a Jupyter Notebook. A description of the variables is given in [Salary metadata.csv](Salary metadata.csv). You will need the packages `matplotlib` / `seaborn`, `pandas` and `statsmodels`.

### Steps and questions

1. Perform some **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** by creating appropriate plots (e.g scatterplots and histograms) to visualise and investigate relationships between dependent variables and the target/independent variable (salary).

    - Create a descriptive statistics table to further characterise and describe the population under investigation.
    - Which variables seem like good predictors of salary?
    - Do any of the variables need to be transformed to be able to use them in a linear regression model?


2. Perform some basic **features engineering** by one-hot encoding the variable Field into three dummy variables, using HR as the reference category. You can use pandas' `get_dummies()` function for this (refer to "Background materials 1-3").

3. Perform **correlation and statistical significance analysis** to validate the relationship salary to each of the potential predictor variables:

    - Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient and plot the corresponding correlation matrix
    - Calculate p-values related to the Pearson correlation coefficients
    - Address any problems that may adversely affect the multiple regression (e.g multicollinearity)


4. Conduct some basic **feature selection** tasks by aggregating results from EDA, correlation matrix and p-values. Justify your feature selection decisions.

5. **Train model**: Split your data into a training and test set. Fit a multiple linear regression model using a training dataset with corresponding features selected above
    - Use the multiple linear regression model created from independent variables selected above and the training dataset to predict _salary_ using the training dataset.
    - Interpret the standardised coefficients given in the statsmodels output.
    - What are the most important features when predicting employee salary?


6. **Evaluate model**: Run your model on the _test set_.

    - Calculate and explain the significance of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R-squared values for your model
    - Calculate the standardised residuals (`resid()`) and standardised predicted values (`fittedvalues()`).
    - Plot the residuals versus the predicted values using seaborn's `residplot` with predicted values as the x parameter, and the actual values as y, specify `lowess=True`.
    - Are there any problems with the regression?


7. **Benchmark with cross-validation model**

    - Perform cross-validation using the training dataset, test and evaluate the cross-validation model with test data
    - Compare performance of the cross-validation model (less prone to over-fitting) to determine whether the developed model has overfitted or not
    - Does it seem like you have a reasonably good model?

## Instructions for reviewer

1. All relevant instructions from the [simple-linear-regression](http://syllabus.africacode.net/projects/data-science-specific/cross-validation-and-simple-linear-regression/index.html) project also apply here.

2. EDA means actually analysing the data; it's not enough to create a graph, there needs to be commentary on what it reveals about the data.

3. For the one-hot encoding, make sure that HR is used as the reference category.

4. An understanding of multi-collinearity should be clearly demonstrated and checked with any of the standard techniques.

5. A common issue is incorrect interpretation of the residuals plot. Make sure interpretation demonstrates understanding for what the residual tell us about the appropriateness of the model.
