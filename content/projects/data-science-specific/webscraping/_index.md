1. Use the packages [requests](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/) and [beautifulsoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) to get the text from the Wikipedia page on [Energy in South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_in_South_Africa).

2. Get only the information from the Overview table 'Energy in South Africa'. Loop through the rows and columns of the table to get the data into a list. Turn the list into a pandas data frame with the table headings (as given in Wikipedia) as the column names.

3. Plot energy production and export between 2004 and 2012 in a line graph. Remember to label your axes clearly and to provide a legend and title.

4. Plot C02 emissions between 2004 and 2012. Remember to label your axes clearly and to provide a legend and title.
