## South African Open Cities

The South African Cities Open Data Almanac has great data, but it is mostly sitting within pdfs and spreadsheets. We can visualise it!

- Choose at least 4 datasets to download from the [State of Cities Report page](http://scoda.opendata.durban/dataset/state-of-cities-report-data-2016). You can choose what information you would like to focus on (employment, energy, etc.).
- Import the data to Google Data Studio and create a 2-page dashboard showing the state of our cities. [Open Data for Africa](http://dataportal.opendataforafrica.org/ymbqap/south-africa-at-a-glance) has a nice example of what such a dashboard could look like
- Remember to use graphs, tables and filters
- Include a heading on each page describing what is shown
- Styling and theme is important - keep it consistent
- Present your dashboard to the team. You will have to interpret the data - what trends do you see? Any areas for concern or optimism?
