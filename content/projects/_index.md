Units of work with strict deadlines to be completed alone or in groups

Projects have three parts:

## PROJECT INTRO

This is when the project is given to the recruits. Everything is explained, they are pointed at useful resources and clear instructions, and they are told the deadline.

## PROJECT DEADLINE

This is when the projects are due. Umuzi staff members will now review the code to give feedback.

### For code projects

The recruits need to provide evidence that they got another recruit to review their work, and that they reviewed another recruits work prior to the deadline.

The recruit is expected to submit code and documentation in the form of a git repo. All git, coding, testing and documentation best practices that the course has covered thus far need to be adhered to.

## PROJECT CODE REVIEW

Once the staff members have reviewed code projects then a code review session will be held. This is a kind of workshop where an Umuzi staff member will present on the project submissions.

- If anyone did something awesome then highlight that
- If there is a common misconception or mistake then highlight that
- highlight any subtle lessons that should have been learned
- get feedback from the recruits, Q&A
- get a few of the recruits to explain parts of their code and approaches to the group

If anyone submitted nonesense - either they were sloppy or they just didn't get it, then don't make them the center of attention. Pull them aside after the code review and have a private discussion. This should happen after the group code review session because that way they will see the standard of the group as a whole and possibly be motivated to conform.
