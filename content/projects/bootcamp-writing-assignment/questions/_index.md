## 1. Your history [200 - 500 words]

Tell us about your personal history. Who are you? Where do you come from? Feel free to include some interesting facts.

## 2. Why do you want this career? [100 - 300 words]

What is it about this career path that attracts you? What inspired this decision? Why did you apply for the specific course you applied for?

## 3. Your free time [ <= 300 words]

How do you spend your free time? You can just give us a list of things you like to do. Some people like to exercise, watch movies, read... what do you like to do?

## 4. Relevant experience [ <= 300 words]

Do you have past experience that you think will be relevant? Maybe you learned to code in school, or built something cool already. Maybe you've even made a website for money before. Maybe you taught yourself some stuff.

If you haven't got relevant experience, don't worry! We're all about giving people opportunities to gain experience.

## 5. What makes you think you'll succeed as a coder? [<= 300 words]

What makes you think you have what it takes? What traits or attributes do you have that will be useful in this setting? Maybe it's past experience? Maybe you have an IQ of 203. Maybe you are good at asking questions. Maybe you just don't give up.

## 6. What might get in the way of your success? [<= 300 words]

The courses offered here are HARD - a lot of people struggle for lots of different reasons.

What weaknesses do you have that might stand in the way of your success? And what strategies do you have for overcoming these challenges?

By anticipating your challenges and setting up strategies ahead of time, you make your success more likely. Also, if we are aware of your challenges we are more able to help you.

## 7. Your routine

Please tell us how you think you'll structure your days in order to get your work done.

Also, the course is pretty much self-paced. So the faster you move the better things can be (so long as you understand!)

- Some people work best in the early hours of the morning. Some people work late at night.
- Some people work on weekends
- some people put in more than 40 hours per week because they just love this stuff, or because they want to get a job sooner

## 8. Your future: the good parts

If you succeed and get a high value career in your chosen field, what do you think your life will look like? Do you have personal goals? How will this effect your family and your community? Is there a big problem you want to solve? Or a business you want to start?

How much is your success worth to you?
## 9. Your future: the scary parts

If you don't manage to launch a value career in your chosen field, what do you think your life will look like? What will this mean for your goals? What about your family and community?

## 10. Your current commitments

What are your current commitments, both financial and time.

We need to know this in order to assess if this opportunity is feasible for you.

NB! Be honest and open, if you are untruthful here this could cause major problems, possibly even dismissal, at a later stage.

## 11. The importance of doing your own work

This course is a great opportunity. Some people try to get in by copying work that isn't theirs and just submitting stuff that they don't understand. When we catch this kind of behavior then we have to reject people. It's kinda sad when that happens.

Imagine a coder who manages to get through the entire syllabus by copying people and submitting work that they can't actually pull off. After the course is over they would try to get a job. If they manage to get a job (by somehow cheating the job interview process) then they would just get fired because they can't actually do anything themselves.

Why? Because professionals solve new problems and do new work. At your first job you'll be asked to use your skills and understanding in order to do something that nobody has ever done before. And if you don't have solid foundational skills then you wont be able to do your job.

In your own words please describe:

- why copying other people's work is a damn silly idea
- why taking the time to fully understand concepts is a good idea
