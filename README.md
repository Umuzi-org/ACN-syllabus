# ACN syllabus

We are on a mission to support as many code schools as we can. Learn more here:

This syllabus is a Hugo based static site (for now). But on top of that, it is the configuration of our Tilde learning platform. You can see [Tilde](https://github.com/Umuzi-org/Tilde) for more.  

I'm sure you've heard of infrastructure-as-code, pipeline-as-code and other x-as-code things? Well, this is a syllabus-as-code. Our learning platform eats this up and generates a bunch of trello-like cards that move across the personal Kanban boards of students using the platform.

In order to make this work, we need to be strict on the shape of the syllabus files. We have very specific naming and metadata conventions that contributors need to follow. We'll talk more about that later. But let's start by getting you set up :)

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5-uaSgIGI0&feature=youtu.be) will walk you trough the whole process. Or you can just read the docs.



## To contribute

We are honoured by any contributions you may want to make.
There are lots of ways to contribute. You can improve the instructions on a specific project, add extra info to some metadata, or spin up a whole new curriculum, if interested, take a minute to read our [contribution guidelines and instructions document](https://github.com/Umuzi-org/ACN-syllabus/blob/develop/contribute.md) for any information about contributing to the project.

## To clone this repo

There is a submodule in here so clone recursively:

Eg:

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:Umuzi-org/ACN-syllabus.git
```

## running locally

This is a Hugo based application.

**PLEASE NOTE** We are using hugo version 0.51. We have run into some annoying problems when upgrading hugo in the past so please just use this version.
If you are tempted to give us a PR that upgrades this to the latest version of hugo, PLEASE DONT. The plan is to upgrade this all to use Eleventy in the near future.

### To get yourself set up on a Debian based machine (linux ubuntu/mint)

```
sudo apt install golang
./install_hugo.sh
```

### MAC

Add this in your bash file e.g .zshrc or .bashrc

```
# Go development
export GOPATH="${HOME}/.go"
export GOROOT="$(brew --prefix golang)/libexec"
export PATH="$PATH:${GOPATH}/bin:${GOROOT}/bin"
```

Run these installs in your terminal using Homebrew

```
brew install go
brew install hugo -> look for version 0.51
```

### To run the development server, once it is installed

```
hugo serve -b "http://localhost:1313/"
```

That's it :) now you'll be able to poke around the main site

### Setting up and running the linter

Make sure you have Python3 installed. This wont work with legacy Python (python2.7 == legacy == dangerzone).
We use [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) for dependency management, to install run

```
pip install pipenv
```

Once installed Pipenv will create a virtual environment and install all required packages, just run
```
pipenv install
```

To activate the environment run
```
pipenv shell
```

You should now be all set to run the linter
```
python lint.py
```

If you want to run the linter again, there's no need to do the whole setup again. Do this:
```
# activate pipenv environment
pipenv shell

# and run the linter
python lint.py
```

The linter starts off by looking over all the frontmatter and making sure that's fine. Then it builds the site and looks for trouble.

Some error messages are a bit funny looking. If you see something like this:

```
content/projects/django-airbnb-clone/users-can-crud-properties/_index.md has unrecognized frontmatter: reatdy
```

Then it means that there is a typo in the given file.

And then if you get a message like this:

```
public/syllabuses/data-eng-boot/index.html:  <span class="contentlink-missing" data="topics/intro-to-tilde"
```

Then that means there is a contentlink that is pointint to a file that doesn't exist. Did the file move? Was it deleted? Is something misspelled?

## Syllabus Content

Look inside the content directory. The documentation is composed of a bunch of markdown files (all named `_index.md`) with a lil metadata. Ok, a lot of metadata.
